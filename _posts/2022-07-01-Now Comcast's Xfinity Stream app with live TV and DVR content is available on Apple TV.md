Comcast's Xfinity Stream app replaced the old Xfinity TV setup in 2017, allowing cable TV subscribers (who haven't cut the cord yet) to pull up live channels, DVR content, and on-demand video, and now it's available in the App Store on Apple TV boxes. Comcast and Apple announced a deal last October to make this happen, as well as an Apple TV Plus app for Comcast's X1 platform, which launched in March for compatible cable boxes, Xfinity Flex, and XClass Smart TVs. Other platforms with the Xfinity Stream app include Roku, Amazon Fire, LG smart TVs, and Samsung smart TVs.
