Niantic is acquiring 8th Wall, a company that helps developers make web-based augmented reality apps, in what it says is its “largest acquisition to date.” The acquisition will help boost Niantic's Lightship developer platform and to help developers “realize their visions for AR in the real-world metaverse,” Niantic's Brian McClendon said in a blog post. (The company is a big fan of the term “real-world metaverse.”) Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, and when asked, Niantic spokesperson Jen Stratton said the details were confidential.
