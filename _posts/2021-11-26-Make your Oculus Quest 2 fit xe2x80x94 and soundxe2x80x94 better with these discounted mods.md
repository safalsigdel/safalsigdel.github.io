The Oculus Quest 2 is an all-around solid piece of hardware, and it's a very popular holiday gift since there are some great deals happening now. But anyone who already owns one can tell you that the company's straps leave a lot to be desired. The cloth strap included in the box isn't supportive, and while the $50 Elite Strap addresses that, it's quite fragile. Mine broke within a year of normal use, and surfing Oculus' Reddit page will show you that some people's straps meet a similar fate.
