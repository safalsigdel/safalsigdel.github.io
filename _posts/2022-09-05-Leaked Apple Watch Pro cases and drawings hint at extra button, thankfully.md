Images of purported third-party accessories for the rumored Apple Watch Pro are making the rounds this morning, and boy do I hope they're legit. Those cutouts mean one or two more physical buttons are being added to the left of the display. CAD drawings later released by 91mobiles show a flat display and a single new button on the left side below a redesigned speaker vent, with a new protrusion on the right that houses the mic, button, and Digital Crown which looks to be better protected from accidental presses.
