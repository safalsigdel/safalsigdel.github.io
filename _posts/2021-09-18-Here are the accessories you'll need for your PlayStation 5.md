Sony's PlayStation 5 is still incredibly difficult to find. Whether you got lucky with a launch unit, or are still trying to snag one for yourself, picking up additional accessories to ensure you get the most out of your brand new console (whenever you get one) isn't a bad idea. From headsets and remotes to M.2 SSDs that allow you to expand your console's storage capacity — that's a thing now, after all — these are just a few PS5 accessories we suggest picking up from the get-go, some of which are now available at a discount.
