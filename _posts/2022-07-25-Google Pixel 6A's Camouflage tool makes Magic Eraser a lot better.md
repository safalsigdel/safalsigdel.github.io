Google's clever Magic Eraser tool debuted on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro. It's an editing feature that's designed to remove people or objects you don't want in the background of your photos. Considering that it's dead simple to use, the results are okay, but it's definitely not putting Adobe out of business anytime soon. But with the Pixel 6A — and coming soon to the 6 and 6 Pro — Google has added a new Magic Eraser function that I like a lot more than the standard erase tool: Camouflage. It's just as easy to use, and the results are a lot more consistent.
