Sony subsidiary Nextorage has released an SSD that's perfect for the PS5 (via Tom's Hardware): it has a heatsink (which Sony says is a requirement), is fast enough to well surpass Sony's recommendations, and comes in 1TB and 2TB varieties, which gives you plenty of storage for your games. The catch? It's kinda expensive, isn't available in the US, and doesn't seem to have an official “PlayStation approved” stamp despite its maker's affiliation with Sony.
