The US Securities and Exchange Commission has charged the would-be creator of a “decentralized” Amazon Web Services alternative with scamming investors out of millions. The SEC announced a complaint on Friday against Australian citizen Craig Sproule, the CEO of cryptocurrency startup Crowd Machine, which promised a global cloud computing network built on users' computers. In reality, Sproule allegedly sent $5.8 million to South African gold mines as investors' cryptocurrency tokens became worthless.
