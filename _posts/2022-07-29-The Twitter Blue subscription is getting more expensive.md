People frequently express their amazement that Twitter is free, but for some people, it isn't — Twitter Blue launched last year in several countries, tacking on a few extra features for anyone willing to pay $2.99 per month.  Today the service told subscribers it's increasing the price (via Matt Navara), and in the US, it's jumping up to $4.99 per month. That probably won't break the pockets of information addicts who are choosing to pay for a service that still includes advertisements in their feed, but it might be enough to make people ask themselves if it's worthwhile.
