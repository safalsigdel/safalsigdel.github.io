The Brazilian government isn't happy about Apple's decision to stop including chargers starting with the launch of the iPhone 12 and has responded by suspending local sales of iPhones that don't come packaged with chargers. In addition to halting some iPhone sales, Brazil's Ministry of Justice and Public Security also ordered Apple to pay a fine of R$12,275,500 (about $2.3 million USD) and canceled the iPhone 12's registration with Anatel, Brazil's telecommunications agency that is similar to the FCC.
