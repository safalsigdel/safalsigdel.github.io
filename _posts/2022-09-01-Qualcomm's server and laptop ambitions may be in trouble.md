Arm is suing Qualcomm and Nuvia, a startup the chipmaker acquired in 2021, claiming that the companies violated the licenses they have to use Arm's processor designs and architecture (via Reuters). Arm's argument is that the licenses it gave Nuvia before it was acquired aren't valid now that it's under new ownership. If Arm wins its suit, Qualcomm could be forced to destroy any work it's done with the particular licenses in question â€” a significant setback for its ambitions to create desktop and server chips using Nuvia's technology.
