Samsung is releasing a new version of The Wall, its massive modular MicroLED display. Measuring in at over 1,000 inches in size, the new “IWA Series” display is aimed at businesses and commercial applications rather than homes, and Samsung's promotional images showcase it being used as a huge display in a retail environment. The display is available in “select markets” from today, but Samsung's press release doesn't publicly list a price.
