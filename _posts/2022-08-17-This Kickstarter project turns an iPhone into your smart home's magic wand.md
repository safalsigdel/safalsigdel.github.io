The smart home has an interface problem, and six undergrads from Duke think they've solved it with a Raspberry Pi and Apple's U1 chip. They believe most of today's methods for controlling smart devices — voice control, fiddly apps with multiple menus, motion sensors — are cumbersome and sometimes frustrating. What the smart home needs, they say, is an intuitive control interface and automations that fire off based on where you are in your home. Basically, one app to rule it all. And they're not wrong.
