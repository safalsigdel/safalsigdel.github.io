The Verge Deals team is back in action this week, serving up some excellent savings from across the internet. If you've been biding your time on buying a new high-end TV, you may want to check out this day-long discount on the 75-inch model of Samsung's QN85B Neo QLED TV, which is selling for its lowest price ever. The QN85B usually sells for $2,799.99 but is currently on sale for $2,399.99. While this QLED model may lack the unparalleled contrast and brightness control of pricier OLED models, the QN85B should deliver stellar picture quality and accurate lighting with its Mini LED technology, atop a number of other excellent features.
