The best deal available today is on the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 with Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity. Usually $399, it's just $279 at Best Buy through Saturday, July 24th. Amazon is honoring this deal, too, even going a bit lower with a $265 price (though, act fast as Amazon's stock tends to sell out faster than Best Buy's). The thing is, this price cut is limited to the Product Red colorway that has a red aluminum case and a red sport band. This is great news for people who can't get enough of the color red in their lives, but it's probably not most people's first choice in terms of how they'd like their Apple Watch to look. It's hard to argue with the price, though. We've seen it sell for $20 less than this, but not since late in April. Read our review of the Apple Watch Series 6.
