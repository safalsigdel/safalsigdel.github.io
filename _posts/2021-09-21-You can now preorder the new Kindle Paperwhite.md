Amazon has officially taken the wraps off of the 11th-gen Kindle Paperwhite ahead of the company's fall event on September 28th, and preorders are now open directly from the retail giant. The new Kindle comes in three flavors: a standard model (with or without ads), a Signature Edition, and one designed for kids. All versions of the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite will launch on October 27th. Preorders are only open at Amazon as of right now, but we'll update this post with more retailers as they become available.
