Perhaps one of the more unexpected announcements from Apple's WWDC event last week was the unveiling of a new 13-inch MacBook Pro that will be equipped with Apple's new M2 processor. While it was initially hinted by Apple that the new MacBook would become available in July, we now know that you can preorder the laptop starting at 8AM EST / 5AM PST on Friday, June 17th, with deliveries and in-store availability beginning on June 24th.
