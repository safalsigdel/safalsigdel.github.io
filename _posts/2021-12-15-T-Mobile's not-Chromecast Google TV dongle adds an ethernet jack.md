T-Mobile's TVision streaming service was not long for this world, but its name lives on in the TVision Hub â€” a $50 dongle with Google TV. It appears to function a lot like Google's own Chromecast, but along with some T-Mobile branding, 9to5Google points out that it offers a feature you won't find on Google's streaming dongle: an ethernet jack. That direct internet connection may be a real benefit if your home Wi-Fi signal isn't quite up to the task of streaming 4K video.
