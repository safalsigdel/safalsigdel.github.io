When the Nintendo Switch OLED Model launched in the fall, it immediately joined the ranks of the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and desktop graphics cards as a sought-after piece of tech that was suddenly out of stock everywhere. While that's still the case for most of those products that I just mentioned — some are only available for close to double their original price on the secondary market — the Switch OLED is no longer difficult to find in stock. The same goes for Microsoft's cheaper next-gen console, the Xbox Series S.
