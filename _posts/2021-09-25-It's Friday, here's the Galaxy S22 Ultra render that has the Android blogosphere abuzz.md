It's Friday, it's fall, there's a breeze in the air (hopefully), and there's fresh, I'd argue ridiculous, renders of Samsung's expected Galaxy S22 Ultra to show you. The renders come courtesy of @OnLeaks and Digit, and they feature a new Samsung flagship with what looks like a Galaxy Note 20-inspired body and back that... well you should see for yourself.
