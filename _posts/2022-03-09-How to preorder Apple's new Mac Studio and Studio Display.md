Following a host of late-breaking rumors, Apple officially announced a new Mac during its “Peek Performance” event today, adding another machine to its expanding desktop lineup. Each configuration of the Mac Studio, as it's called, will feature either Apple's M1 Max or its new M1 Ultra processor, with the M1 Max and M1 Ultra models starting at $1,999 and $3,999, respectively. Apple also introduced the forthcoming Studio Display, a new monitor that starts at $1,599 and is designed as a companion to Apple's new desktop machine. Both products are available for preorder starting today and will begin shipping on Friday, March 18th.
