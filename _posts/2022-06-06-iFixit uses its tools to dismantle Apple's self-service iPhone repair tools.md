iFixit regularly performs dissections of the latest Apple gadgets, but this time, the repair resource site pitted its tools against other tools by taking apart Apple's new iPhone self-service repair kit (via iMore). The take-apart process on Apple's repair tools was documented and posted on iFixit's YouTube channel, giving an inside look at the display press, battery press, and heated display removal contraptions.
