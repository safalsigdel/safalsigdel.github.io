Generally, I do not even lift, bro. I am a cardio gal who begrudgingly strength trains when I remember it'll help me run faster. Some of that is because I hate being perceived by judgy gym bros. Some of it is my lack of confidence in throwing together a good, varied routine for my goals. Coincidentally, connected fitness thus far has also been primarily cardio-heavy and struggles with strength training. Either you're grappling with clunky connected weights, or you're spending thousands to install a high-tech system like Tonal in your home. That's why, at $295, the camera-based Peloton Guide is an interesting proposition.
