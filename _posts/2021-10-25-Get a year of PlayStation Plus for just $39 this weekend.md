For this weekend, you can get a whole year of Playstation Plus at Eneba for just $39 by using the code 365USVERGE at checkout. Anyone who owns a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 should consider becoming a PlayStation Plus subscriber. By becoming one, you get access to a variety of perks, including online multiplayer, cloud storage for saves, and complementary games every month, as well as exclusive discounts. This discount is only valid through Saturday, October 23rd, though, so you'll have to move fast.
