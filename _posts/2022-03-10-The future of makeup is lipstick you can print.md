I don't generally think of wearing lipstick as a high-tech experience. But while applying a custom shade of bright red this morning, I realized that's exactly what I'd just had. I'd taken a picture of my outfit on my smartphone, and an app generated a few colors to go with it. I then got to try each of them on using AR filters. Once I found the shade I liked, I hit a button, and the $299 Yves Saint Laurent Rouge Sur Mesure printed a pea-sized amount for me to wear.
