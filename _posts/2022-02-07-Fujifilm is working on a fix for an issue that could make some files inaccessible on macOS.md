Fujifilm says it's working on a patch to fix an incompatibility issue preventing the owners of certain X series and GFX series cameras from accessing some of their files on macOS, as stated in a notice on Fujifilm's site. According to the post, the issue only occurs when users have over 4,000 files written in-camera to a single folder on their SDXC card and then try to access these files using an internal or external card reader connected to their Mac.
