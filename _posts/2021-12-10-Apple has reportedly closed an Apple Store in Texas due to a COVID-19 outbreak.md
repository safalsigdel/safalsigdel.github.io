Apple closed one of its Southlake, Texas retail stores Wednesday after many staff members contracted COVID-19, according to NBC News' Zoe Schiffer. A manager told employees Wednesday that 22 staffers “have shared that they're positive for COVID-19,” NBC News reported, and four of the store's 151 employees reported positive cases right after Black Friday.
