This week, I'm talking to Chuck Todd, the political director at NBC News and moderator of Meet The Press, the longest-running television show in the country. Seriously: Meet the Press started in 1946, and Chuck is only the 12th moderator the show's ever had. And as streaming upends television, he's expanding Meet The Press from a single weekly show where he interviews politicians to an entire roster of formats: there's Meet the Press, Meet The Press Daily on MSNBC, Meet the Press Reports on the Peacock streaming service, and, of course, a Meet the Press podcast.
