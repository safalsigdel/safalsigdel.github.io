I have been told to blog about Senator Josh Hawley's new copyright bill, and I do this with nothing but the greatest reluctance. Normally, I love talking about copyright! I'll talk about copyright all day long! [Ed note: And she does.] But writing this post is agony, because the thought of giving this absolutely asinine piece of legislation any attention is killing me on the inside.
