Wink, the once-innovative smart home platform, has been down for two weeks with no sign of a fix. The outage has left customers of the Will-i-am-owned company — who pay $5 a month for the service to run their connected lights, locks, sensors, and other devices through the Wink Hub — completely in the lurch. It's so bad that even Wink's website and email are affected, which gives off strong whiffs of “somebody didn't pay the bill this month.”
