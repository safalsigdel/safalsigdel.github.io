Images of purported third-party accessories and CAD drawings for the rumored Apple Watch Pro are making the rounds this morning, and boy do I hope they're legit. The cases show cutouts for another physical button added to the left of the watch face, while CAD drawings released separately by 91mobiles align with the cutouts. The drawings also show a completely flat display and a new button on the left side below a redesigned speaker vent, with a new protrusion on the right that houses the mic, button, and Digital Crown which looks to be better protected from accidental presses.
