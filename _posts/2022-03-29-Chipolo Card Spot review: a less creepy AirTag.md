Item trackers were made for absent-minded people like me. Not a day goes by that I don't ping my iPhone from my Apple Watch so I can find where I left it. I usually need it so I can open the Find My app to find my keys. I've misplaced my phone in the fridge, lost my wallet in the Minneapolis-St. Paul international airport, and left my passport behind on the greasy counter of a Queens diner. Given my dismal track record, I was eager to try the $35 Chipolo Card Spot â€” a slim card-shaped Bluetooth tracker that works on Apple's Find My network.
