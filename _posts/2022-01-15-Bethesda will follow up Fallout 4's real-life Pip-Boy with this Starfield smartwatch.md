Starfield, Bethesda's upcoming space-themed game, may feature an in-game smartwatch that you'll be able to get and wear in real life, based on an early copy of a manual found by Reddit user SquiddyVonn. The manual details the real-life watch's functions, which include showing the weather and step tracking, and it even includes pictures that give us a good look at the interface. It also shows us that the watch is being made by a well-known replica company that's worked with Bethesda in the past.
