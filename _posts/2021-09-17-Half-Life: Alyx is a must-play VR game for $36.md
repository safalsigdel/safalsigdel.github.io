Half-Life: Alyx belongs in every VR headset owner's library of games, especially when it costs 40 percent less than usual. This game was released right at the start of the pandemic in early 2020 for $60, and while it's worth every bit of that price, I highly suggest taking advantage of this deal, which drops the game to just $36. Not only does the game satisfy with respect to its story, which serves as the prequel to Half-Life 2 (you really need to see the ending), it's a fantastic experience full of imaginative VR gameplay that makes every environment feel like a sandbox.
