AMD has officially debuted its new Ryzen 6000 CPUs for laptops at CES 2022, featuring the company's upgraded Zen 3 Plus architecture, a new 6nm process node, and the debut of AMD's RDNA 2 graphics architecture for its integrated GPUs. AMD is promising some big gains here, too: up to 1.3 times faster processing, up to two times the gaming performance of the previous generation, and up to 24 hours of battery life.
