The Samsung M8 Smart Monitor is one of those products that dazzle you with its abundance of features to overshadow the fact that most of them are gimmicks. But gimmicks aside, it's a stylish 32-inch 4K monitor-slash-smart-TV for people who don't have the space, money, or desire for two large, expensive displays. Plenty of people already use their monitors as TVs, and if you're buying one big 4K HDR screen anyway, why not have it pull double duty?
