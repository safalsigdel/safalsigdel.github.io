When we were kids, my friends and I used to play a game we called “Be Whoever You Want,” where we'd pretend to be our heroes from video games, TV shows, and movies. Goku, Vegeta, or other Dragon Ball characters were a popular choice — we'd imagine that we could fly great distances and launch powerful Kamehameha beams to “fight” each other. Many years later, thanks to Fortnite's new Dragon Ball-themed event that kicked off on Tuesday, I've been able to live out those childhood dreams of feeling like an actual Super Saiyan.
