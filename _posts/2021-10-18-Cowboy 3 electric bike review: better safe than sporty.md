Cowboy has returned with its third-generation e-bike. It's still the best-looking pedal-assisted electric bike with a removable battery that I've ever seen having carried forward the same physical design as the original Cowboy. While the Cowboy 2 from last year was sporty, the Cowboy 3 is mature, focusing on safety rather than fun.
