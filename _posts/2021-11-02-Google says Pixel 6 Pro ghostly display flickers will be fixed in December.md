Google says it'll fix the ghostly screen flickering that some users have reported seeing when pressing the Pixel 6 Pro's power button while the phone is completely powered down (via Android Central). From most reports, the flickers don't happen when just the screen is off, like it would be if the phone was sleeping, though at least one person says that it's happened while the phone was on and in use. Google describes the issue as occurring when the power button is pushed “with slight pressure but not enough to turn [the Pixel 6 Pro] on.”
