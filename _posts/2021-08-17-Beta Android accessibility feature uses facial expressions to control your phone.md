Google is developing a new accessibility feature for Android that lets you control a phone using facial expressions like a smile or raised eyebrows, XDA Developers reports. The “Camera Switch” feature has arrived with version 12 of Android's Accessibility Suite app, released alongside Android 12's fourth beta. The new version of the app isn't available via Google Play just yet, XDA reports, but there's an APK to sideload if you want to give it a try.
