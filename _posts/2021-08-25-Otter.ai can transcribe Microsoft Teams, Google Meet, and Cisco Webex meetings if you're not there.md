Otter.ai is one of our favorite transcription tools thanks to the accuracy of its machine learning-generated notes. If you're a paying user, you can also use its Otter Assistant feature to plug into your calendar and automatically join and transcribe meetings even if you're not there. Previously, Otter Assistant only worked with Zoom meetings, but today the company is expanding it to integrate with Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Cisco Webex meetings.
