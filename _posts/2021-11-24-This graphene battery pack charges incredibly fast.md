Update November 24th, 09:30AM ET: The original Indiegogo campaign was terminated (with all contributions refunded) and reinstated here. The issue, according to Elecjet, resulted from a recent change in the legal designation of the company from LLC to Corporation that unexpectedly changed its Tax ID and the campaign's ability to process payments. Unfortunately, the delay incurred by the relaunch means that Elecjet can no longer guarantee shipment by Christmas.
