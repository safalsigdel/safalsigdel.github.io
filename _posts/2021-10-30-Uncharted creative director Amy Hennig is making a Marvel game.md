Amy Hennig, a former creative director at Naughty Dog who currently leads Skydance New Media, will be working on a new Marvel video game. Skydance describes the game, which is its first, as a “narrative-driven, blockbuster action-adventure game, featuring a completely original story and take on the Marvel Universe” but hasn't said which superheroes will be featured in the game. The studio also hasn't shared a release date (or even a release timeframe) and hasn't said which platforms the game will be available on.
