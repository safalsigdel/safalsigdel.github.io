The Alpha ZV-E10 is Sony's newest addition to its lineup of mirrorless cameras. At $799.99 with Sony's 16-50 lens ($699.99 for just the body), it is the company's second attempt at making a vlogging-oriented camera and the successor to last year's ZV-1. It adds a headphone jack, more battery life, a larger sensor, and most importantly, an interchangeable lens design.
