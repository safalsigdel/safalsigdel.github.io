Somehow, we've reached the middle of April, which means graduation for the class of 2022 is just around the corner (congrats in advance). If you're looking for a pricey-yet-practical gift, Apple's newest 14-inch MacBook Pro would certainly be a welcome present. It's an especially good one to consider today now that this model is on sale for just $1 shy of its best price to date. Right now, Amazon is selling the M1 Pro-powered MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $1,749.99 ($200 off). Note, however, that the current discounted price applies at checkout.
