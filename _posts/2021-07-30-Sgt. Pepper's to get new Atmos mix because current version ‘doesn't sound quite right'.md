The Beatles seminal Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is set to receive another Dolby Atmos mix, after producer Giles Martin, son of the album's original producer George Martin, admitted that the current version “doesn't sound quite right.” The current mix, produced by the younger Martin in 2017, was made with Dolby Atmos theaters in mind, rather than personal listening via services like Apple Music. “I'm gonna replace it,” the said the two time Grammy winner to Rolling Stone. “It's good. But it's not right.”
