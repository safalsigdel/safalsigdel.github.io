Each year, it seems that more companies are trying out devices with foldable screens. In the PC space, results for those have been... mixed. But Asus is known for doing funky things, especially funky things with screens. So it was only a matter of time before the company tried its hand at one of these, and we're finally getting a look at the first generation. Say hello to the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED, a 17.3-inch laptop with a foldable OLED screen. For those seeking a more traditional offering, there's also a clamshell Zenbook 14 OLED coming later this year.
