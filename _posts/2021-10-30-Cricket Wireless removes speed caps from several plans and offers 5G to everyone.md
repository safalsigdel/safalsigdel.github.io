Cricket Wireless suddenly has several more options if you're looking for access to 5G on a prepaid wireless plan. That's because starting today, it will offer nationwide 5G access across all of its plans, which launched a year ago with support for only one device and only on its more expensive unlimited plans. Cricket Wireless also revealed it's added 2 million customers in the last two years and is now serving some 12.4 million subscribers.
