The years-in-the-making Minecraft movie from Warner Bros. might be one step closer to becoming a reality, as Jason Momoa, who you might know as Aquaman, is in “final negotiations” to star, according to Substack publication The Ankler, The Hollywood Reporter, and Variety.

Warner Bros. didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.
