General Motors wants to be the biggest seller of electric vehicles in the world, and the new 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV is intended to play a major role in that effort. Built on GM's Ultium platform, the midsize SUV will get up to 300 miles of range and will start at “around $30,000” — an affordable price point that's intended to drive broader EV adoption.
