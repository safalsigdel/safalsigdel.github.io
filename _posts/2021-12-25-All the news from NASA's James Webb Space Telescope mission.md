On Christmas Day, NASA is slated to launch one of its most anticipated spacecraft in decades: a next-generation observatory dubbed the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST. It's taken roughly 25 years for NASA to get this vehicle ready for launch, and sending it to space is an incredibly complex endeavor.
