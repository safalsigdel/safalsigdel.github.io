Visible, Verizon's app-based affordable mobile carrier alternative, appears to have canceled users' accounts in lieu of denying them access to a promotion. This news came to light after a number of Visible customers posted complaints on Twitter and Reddit, claiming their service was canceled without explanation, as first reported by Best MVNO (via XDA Developers).
