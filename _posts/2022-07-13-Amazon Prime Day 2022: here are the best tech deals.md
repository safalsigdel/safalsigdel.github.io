Welcome to our repository of only the best Amazon Prime Day 2022 deals for Prime members. What will you find in here? You'll find big discounts on tech products that we actually like, and other Verge-y stuff that we feel comfortable recommending based on specs and price. What you won't find are bad, also-ran deals that appear at several other times of the year. You don't have time for that, and we don't have time for that, either. That criteria means we're trying to keep the list trim to make it easier to peruse.
