It's April, which means we've reached shipping season for the latest and greatest TVs announced back at CES. I recently had a chance to get a preview of Samsung's 2022 lineup in person. Samsung is the number one TV maker in the world by market share, and the reason for that success is that Samsung sticks closely to its smartphone strategy: there are TVs at every price point, whether you want a giant 8K TV — there's still no reason to buy one of those, people — or a budget 4K set that's far more sensible in price.
