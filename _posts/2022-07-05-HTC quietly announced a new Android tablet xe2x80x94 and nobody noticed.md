HTC, the once-impressive Android smartphone manufacturer, has a surprise tablet to accompany its bizarre metaverse-focused Desire 22 Pro. The new A100 (or A101, depending on your region) is an Android tablet with a 10.1-inch display, entry-level specs, and a design that's straight out of the middle of the last decade. The device, which we spotted via AndroidPolice, appears to have been quietly announced last month — according to the Wayback Machine — and is destined for Africa, Latin America, and Russia, where it's priced at 20,990 rubles, aka a weirdly uncompetitive $337.
