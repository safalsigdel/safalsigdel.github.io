My startup went public, and it only took me about 25 minutes to pull it off. I don't remember what the company does, though I don't think it really matters? I own 16 percent of the place, but after I made some rash decisions about a legal fight and opted to set up a local office in India, the company basically doesn't have any cash left on hand. Users love us, though! So the future's bright for... whatever our name is. It doesn't matter. In a minute, I'll start over and try something else.
