Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but that doesn't mean there aren't any AirPods deals to be had. In October, Apple finally launched its third generation of AirPods, introducing a new AirPods lineup and dropping the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level AirPods from $159 to $129. Since then, we've seen many retailers starting to discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We've even seen some of the first discounts on the latest AirPods, despite how recently they launched.
