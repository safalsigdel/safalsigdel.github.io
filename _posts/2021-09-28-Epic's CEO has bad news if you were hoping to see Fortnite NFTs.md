On Monday, Tim Sweeney tweeted that Epic isn't touching NFTs, in a public response to what was presumably an NFT pitch. He cites the space's problem with scams as the reason for his hesitancy, which sparked some discussion in the comments (as strong statements about crypto tend to do). Sweeney has since clarified his views on NFTs a little, saying that, to him, owning an NFT is about as valuable as liking an image on Twitter and calling into question whether NFT ownership is actually non-fungible.
