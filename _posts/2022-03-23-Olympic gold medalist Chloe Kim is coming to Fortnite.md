Yet another notable athlete is coming to Fortnite's battle royale. Epic Games announced that on March 26th, players will be able to snag a skin based on two-time Olympic gold medalist snowboarder Chloe Kim. The skin features four different color schemes — including a black-and-gold option and another where she appears encased in ice — and there are also a handful of accessories, including a giant frozen dragon to ride on.
