If you've struggled to justify buying Apple's AirPods Max at their usual $420-plus price (at Apple, they're still $549), head over to Woot and check out this deal on refurbished models that cost just $369.99. You can choose between space gray, sky blue, and green, each of which Woot says are “Apple Certified Reconditioned” and have “no visible scratches or blemishes and appear practically brand new!” Though, as is usually the case, the warranty for these refurbished headphones isn't as good as buying new ones. You'll get 90 days instead of a full year.
