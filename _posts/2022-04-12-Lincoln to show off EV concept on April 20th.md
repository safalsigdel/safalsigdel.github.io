Lincoln, Ford's luxury brand, has announced that it'll show off a “fully electric concept vehicle” on April 20th as a way to tease upcoming electric offerings. In a short video, the company shows off a partial outline of the vehicle, which will likely be a smaller SUV or crossover, as the company currently doesn't make any sedans (sad news for anyone like me who would love a Hyundai-esque '80s Continental revival).
