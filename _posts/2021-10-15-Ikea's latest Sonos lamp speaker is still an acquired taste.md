The first table lamp speaker from Ikea and Sonos was a littlexe2x80xa6 strange. With its bulbous, mushroom-esque lampshade, fabric-covered speaker, and a plate beneath it all, the original Symfonisk lamp wasn't exactly a universal fit for home decor. But the concept of a lamp that also doubles as a capable speaker was in itself a good idea â€” so the companies are back with their second try at it.
