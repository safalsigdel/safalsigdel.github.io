At least one of Intel's forthcoming 13th-generation CPUs will be able to run at 6GHz at stock, Tom's Hardware reports. The detail was shared in a slide onstage at Intel's Technology Tour 2022, which also says it'll be capable of hitting 8GHz when overclocked. Other improvements promised for this new generation, which is named Raptor Lake, include a 15 percent improvement in single-threaded performance, and a 41 percent improvement in multi-threaded performance.
