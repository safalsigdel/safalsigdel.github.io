Google is finally adding an official dark mode to search on desktops, letting those who prefer to avoid bright webpages complete their searches while bathed in inky gray (via 9to5Google). According to Google's support page, you can make the change by going to Settings > Search Settings > Appearance. There, you'll be able to choose light, dark, or device default, which will automatically follow your computer's mode. If you don't see the Appearance option, you may have to wait a bit: Google says the setting will be “rolling out over the next few weeks,” as many of its updates do.
