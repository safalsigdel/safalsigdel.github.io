When I reviewed the 15-inch Galaxy Book Pro 360 earlier this year, I concluded that it was great â€” but that its somewhat unique combination of a 15-inch OLED screen, integrated graphics, and a stylus at a fairly premium price point made its audience fairly specific. The package it offers is somewhat unusual in the 15-inch space.
