Amazon's next Fire 7 tablet will come with a new version of the company's Fire OS operating system, called Fire OS 8 (h/t to Liliputing and AFTVNews). It's based on Android 11, which is a pretty significant upgrade to the foundational tech currently powering Amazon's tablets; the previous version, Fire OS 7, is based on Android 9, which was released in 2018.
