Spotify is testing a new feature that brings popular user-created playlists to the app's homepage. If you're a part of the test, the recommended playlists will appear in their own Featured Curator carousel. Spotify says it's piloting the feature in “select markets” but doesn't specify where exactly it's rolling it out or on which devices.
