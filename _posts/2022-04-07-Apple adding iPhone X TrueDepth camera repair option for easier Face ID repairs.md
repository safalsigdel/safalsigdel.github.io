Apple reportedly will soon provide a new Face ID repair option for iPhone X that doesn't involve replacing the whole device (via MacRumors). The option comes after Apple's recent shift to soon provide a TrueDepth Camera service option that can fix the face unlock feature of the 2018 iPhone XS and newer models but didn't previously include the 2017 iPhone X.
