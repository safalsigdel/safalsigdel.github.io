Valve is working to add support for the Nintendo Switch's Joy-Con controllers in Steam. As part of the newest Steam beta, Joy-Cons will be supported either individually or as a matched pair, similar to how you can use them either way for Switch games. If you want to try the feature out, you can opt into the Steam beta — Valve has helpful instructions on the Steam website — though fingers crossed that your Joy-Cons aren't experiencing any drift.
