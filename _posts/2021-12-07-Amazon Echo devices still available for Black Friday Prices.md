Black Friday has come and gone, but many awesome deals are still sticking around. Amazon and Best Buy are still offering the second-gen Echo Show 5 for $44.99, the lowest price we've seen for this smart device. And while not quite the same price we saw on Cyber Monday, the Echo Show 8 is also available for a sizeable $40 discount, taking the price of this smart screen down to just $94.99. Both of these second-generation smart displays are similar in form and function, with the Echo Show 8 featuring a slightly larger screen and a more powerful, 13MP camera.
