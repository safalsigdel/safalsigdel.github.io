This may sound familiar, but there's something wrong with the latest software update for Google's Pixel 6 phones. As Google tweaks the version of Android it distributes to phones running its custom Tensor chip, there have been some odd issues, but instead of problems with Wi-Fi or a slow thumbprint scanner, this time, it's affecting another key feature: notifications.
