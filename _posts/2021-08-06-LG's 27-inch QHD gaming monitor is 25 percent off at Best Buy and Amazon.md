Gaming monitors can be a very expensive component of building or upgrading your PC. If you don't want to shell out $500 or more, Best Buy has an attractive deal on a monitor that ticks a lot of boxes for the cost. LG's 27-inch UltraGear costs $300 at Best Buy and Amazon, down from $400, and it has a 1440p IPS panel with a 144Hz refresh rate and fast 1ms response time. For adaptive sync, it has both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility. It has slim bezels with up to 350 nits of brightness for its display. Around its back, there are two HDMI 2.0 ports and a DisplayPort 1.4 port.
