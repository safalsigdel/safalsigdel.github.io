After a tease last week, Fortnite's highly anticipated collaboration with Naruto is finally here. Starting Tuesday, you'll be able to play as characters from the hugely popular anime series Naruto: Shippuden in Epic Games' hit battle royale. There will be four Naruto characters that are now available in the in-game item shop — Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and Kakashi Hatake — as well as a Naruto glider, two emotes, and two loading screens.
