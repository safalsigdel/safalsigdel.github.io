Legendary artist John Harris is best-known for his almost ethereal paintings of science fiction landscapes â€” and soon, there will be a new collection of his work for fans to dig into. Titan Books has announced The Art of John Harris II: Into the Blue, a hardcover book curating decades of work from the 73-year-old painter. The new collection will focus on his more futuristic paintings, as well as give readers a behind-the-scenes look at how certain projects went from sketch to completed work.
