Chrome's latest update for iOS will let you secure your incognito tabs with Touch ID, Face ID, or a passcode (via MacRumors). When the new feature is rolled out to you, you can turn it on by navigating to the settings menu, then tapping “Privacy,” then “Lock Incognito tabs.” I just updated the app and the option wasn't there for me, so you might have to wait just a bit until you can flip it on. Google first revealed it was testing this new privacy feature in February.
