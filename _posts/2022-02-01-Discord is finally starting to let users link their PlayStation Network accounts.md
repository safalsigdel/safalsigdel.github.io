Discord is finally rolling out the ability to connect your PlayStation Network account to the chat app, following an announcement last May that it and Sony would “bring the Discord and PlayStation experiences closer together on console and mobile.” Right now, the integration is pretty limited, both in terms of what it can do and seemingly who has access to it, but it's likely the first step for things to come later. Outside of its partnership with Sony, Discord is also working on an interesting account management feature that we'd love to see make it to everyone.
