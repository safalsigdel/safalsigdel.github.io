For the few who don't already know, every variety of Nintendo's popular Switch console can get a storage upgrade by installing a microSD card. And while you're most likely to stumble upon deals for microSD cards with 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of storage, there's a must-see deal happening at Amazon on the SanDisk 400GB variant. Normally $69.99 (but usually between $45 and $50), you can snag one now for just $39.99. It's just a couple dollars shy of the best-ever price.
