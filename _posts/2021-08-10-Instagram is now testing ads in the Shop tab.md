If you thought Instagram had run out of ad real estate, think again. The company confirmed to TechCrunch today that it's starting a new test that'll involve putting ads on its Shop tab. Ads will involve either a single image or carousel of them, and of course, will be shoppable. Only certain advertisers will have access at first, but there are plans to expand the product in the future. (Initial US-based partners include Away, Fenty Beauty, and Clare paint.)
