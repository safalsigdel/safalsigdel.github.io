Stranger Things 4, the most recent season of the hit show, just became the second Netflix show ever to surpass a billion hours viewed. Since the first installment of the season dropped on May 27th, viewers have spent a cumulative 1.15 billion hours watching the season's nine episodes, including 301 million hours just this past weekend. That makes Stranger Things 4 the second most-watched Netflix season ever, after Squid Game in 2021. It was in Netflix's Top 10 in 93 different countries this weekend, the company says. The show is so popular right now that it's boosting the older seasons, too: all four Stranger Things seasons were in Netflix's six most-watched shows over the weekend, with only The Umbrella Academy able to keep up.
