Finding a good show to watch after a long day of work can sometimes require too much brain power — at least if you're as lazy as I am. That's why a streaming device that's simple to use, like Roku's latest Streaming Stick 4K, can be so great. All of your streaming service apps are easily and quickly accessible in a big grid, and Roku even highlights free content that doesn't require subscription services for those of us who are both lazy and cheap. While we wish there were support for Wi-Fi 6 and USB-C in the latest version, it does support Dolby Vision, Apple's AirPlay 2, and both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice assistants.
