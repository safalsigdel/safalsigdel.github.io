Microsoft launched its new cloud PC Windows 365 service earlier this week, and the company has already had to pause free trials due to demand. Windows 365 lets you rent a cloud PC — with a variety of CPU, RAM, and storage options — and then stream Windows 10 or Windows 11 via a web browser. The service reached max capacity after only a day of signups.
