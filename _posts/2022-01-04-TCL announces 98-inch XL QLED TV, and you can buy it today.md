Last year, TCL announced an “XL” TV series that aimed to offer very big 85-inch displays for prices below what you'd pay for a similarly enormous set from, say, Samsung or LG. And in the first week of 2022, the XL lineup is going even larger. Today TCL is introducing a new 98-inch 4K QLED TV that's available for purchase immediately. The 98R754 is a Google TV-based set that offers features like 4K gaming at 120Hz.
