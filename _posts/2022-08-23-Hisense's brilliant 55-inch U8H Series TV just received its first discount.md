If you're in the market for an excellent 4K TV — whether to game or enjoy fantasy epics like HBO's House of the Dragon and the upcoming Lord of the Rings TV show — Best Buy is currently selling Hisense's new U8H Series TV in the 55-inch configuration for just $699.99 ($450 off). This is the best price we've seen on one of the more premium offerings in Hisense's 2022 “ULED” TV lineup, which sits just underneath the brighter U9H Series.
