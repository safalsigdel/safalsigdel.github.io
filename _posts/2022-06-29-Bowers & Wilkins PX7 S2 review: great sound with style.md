You don't buy Bowers & Wilkins headphones out of practicality. The company's latest over-ear pair, the $399 PX7 S2, isn't going to be the default, obvious choice for most people shopping for noise-canceling headphones. But where the British audio brand seeks to separate itself from Sony, Bose, and other competitors is in craftsmanship and nailing the small details. These are headphones where the elegant design is just as much of a selling point as sonic performance. With this new model, Bowers & Wilkins is promising advancements in comfort, noise cancellation, and even better sound fidelity. The company delivers on all of those fronts, even if there are still weaknesses elsewhere.
