Panicking because Father's Day is just around the corner and you have yet to pick up your dad something special? Fret not because we've got your back. We did a bit of digging and found a variety of excellent gadgets Dad will love, all of which you can still order today and receive in time for Father's Day. You don't necessarily need to be an Amazon Prime member to receive some of these in time for the holiday either, nor do you need to pay extra for expedited shipping at places like Best Buy, Target, or Walmart.
