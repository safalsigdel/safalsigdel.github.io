One of the first things I bought at the start of the pandemic was a set of adjustable dumbbells. My husband and I both wanted to strength train, but we needed several different weights. He had actual muscles while I had noodle arms. The problem was our apartment couldn't accommodate a full rack. Adjustable dumbbells seemed like a sensible choice. And it was until it wasn't. During a set of chest presses, the pin securing the weight plates broke. I got a 5-pound plate to the face. So, as you can imagine, I was wary about testing the $429 (or as low as $300 on sale) NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells.
