Google Photos now lets you order prints of specific photographs and get them shipped to homes in the US for as little as $0.18 plus shipping, the company has announced. Although it's previously been possible to print individual photos through Google Photos, until now you've had to pick them up from a local Walmart, CVS, or Walgreens. Otherwise, getting prints shipped has required paying for Google's $6.99 a month photo subscription, which sends 10 cardstock photo prints each month.
