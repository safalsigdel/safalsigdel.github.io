It makes me feel very old to say this, but we are on the ninth generation of Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon. And there have been nine of these for a reason. The X1 Carbon has historically been one of the best business laptops you can get. And that remains the case with its newest iteration. Lenovo has made a few tweaks, but otherwise, it's the same ThinkPad excellence we've come to expect.
