If you plan to get some typing done on your iPad, Apple's Smart Keyboard might be a good accessory to pick up. Right now, it's $115 at Amazon, which is $44 off its usual price. It has plummeted to around $100 before, according to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel, but this is a great deal if you need to buy right now. This model can work with the previous and current generation of the base 10.2-inch iPad, as well as the last-gen 10.5-inch iPad Air or the last-gen 10.5-inch iPad Pro models.
