In case you hadn't noticed, it's becoming ever-so-slightly less of a maddening exercise to get your hands on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Granted, it's still harder than it should be, but recent retailer restocks have taken longer to sell out than they used to. So, here's hoping that you're able to purchase whichever console you want during today's restock at Walmart, which is specifically for paid Walmart Plus subscribers and going on right now.
