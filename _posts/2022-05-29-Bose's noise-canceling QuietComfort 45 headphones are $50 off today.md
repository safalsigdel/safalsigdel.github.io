If you're planning on flying this summer, a good pair of noise-canceling headphones that can help you tune out fellow passengers like the Bose QuietComfort 45s can come in handy. Regularly $329, you can buy them right now for $279 from Amazon, Best Buy, and Bose, which matches its all-time low and is the first significant discount we've seen in months.
