Last month, Nvidia settled the age-old question once and for all â€” yes, it can run Crysis, whatever it is, as long as it can stream the company's GeForce Now cloud gaming service. To prove it, Nvidia's now giving away a copy of Crysis Remastered for free with every new six-month GeForce Now subscription, as well as the first wave of customers who've already subscribed or preordered GeForce Now's impressive new RTX 3080 tier. It's a limited-time offer.
