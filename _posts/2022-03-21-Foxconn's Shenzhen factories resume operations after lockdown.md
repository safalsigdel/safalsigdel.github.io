Foxconn, the world's biggest contract manufacturer of electronics, says it's “basically” resumed normal operations in Shenzhen after a partial lockdown forced its factories offline, Reuters reports. In a statement, the company said it has “basically resumed normal work order and production operations” at its Longhua and Guanlan factories, although it added it will be “strictly implementing epidemic prevention and control” policies and that some staff will live and work in a bubble. Reuters notes that employees in Futian, a district of Shenzhen, are still being advised to work from home.
