Some of us get excited about shopping for a new phone (New technology! Megapixels! Fancy screen!), but none of us enjoy shopping for a new phone plan.

With more 5G spectrum coming online this year — and carriers inventing more words for it— understanding what a phone plan includes and picking the right one is difficult. While we can't promise to make it an enjoyable experience, we can help you do a little homework ahead of time to make it less painful.
