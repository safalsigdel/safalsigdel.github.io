Amazon is increasing the price of its music streaming service, the company has announced in a new FAQ. From May 5th, Amazon Prime subscribers will have to pay $8.99 (xc2xa38.99) a month or $89 (xc2xa389) a year for access to Music Unlimited, up from $7.99 (xc2xa37.99) and $79 (xc2xa379) respectively. The price of the single-device plan — which lets you listen to the full library but only from a single Echo or Fire TV device — is also increasing from $3.99 (xc2xa33.99) to $4.99 (xc2xa34.99) a month. If you're not a Prime member, the price of Amazon Music Unlimited is unchanged at $9.99 (xc2xa39.99).
