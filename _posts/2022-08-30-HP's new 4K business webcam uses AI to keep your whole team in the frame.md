HP has a new webcam that feels familiar and uses AI to keep you and your fidgeting guests in the frame during meetings. The $199.99 HP 965 4K Streaming webcam is the company's new business-oriented model that contains a Sony Starvis CMOS sensor, similar in spec (and price) to Dell's 4K webcam offering, Elgato's Facecam, and Razer's Kiyo Pro. A home office 960 version is available in white but, according to HP spokesperson Christine Wahl, has identical specs, and after initially appearing on HP's website with a $50 discount, the 960 is now priced identically with the 965.
