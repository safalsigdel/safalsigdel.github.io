Apple's AirTag accessories are, ironically, often more expensive than the Ultra Wideband-ready Bluetooth tracker itself. Today, however, you can pick up a leather AirTag loop in either brown or red at Amazon for $29, the lowest price Amazon has sold the accessory for since its release in the spring. That's a great thing given the nature of AirTags, which controversially lack a lanyard hole that would make accessorizing so much easier and likely cheaper, too.
