Several years ago, I had to deal with a situation that may be familiar to a lot of people: I was slammed with a series of high medical bills that had been denied by the insurance company. The doctor was in network, but according to the insurance company, his bills were coded wrong. Or wait, his facilities weren't in network orxe2x80xa6 well, you get the idea. It took over a year and many phone calls to iron out the issue â€” and I wouldn't have gotten through it had I not been able to record each phone call I made with the insurance company and the various medical facilities involved.
