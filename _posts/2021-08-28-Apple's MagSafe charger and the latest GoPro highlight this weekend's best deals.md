The ecosystem of MagSafe chargers for the iPhone 12 might not be very expansive, but it's hard to go wrong with Apple's base magnetic wireless charger â€” especially when it's discounted to $30 at Amazon. The magnetic puck can provide the iPhone 12 Mini with up to 12 watts of power or the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro with up to 15 watts, so long as you use a 20-watt power brick. It can also top off other iPhones that support wireless charging without magnets. In fact, it can power up any device that supports Qi charging, including AirPods.
