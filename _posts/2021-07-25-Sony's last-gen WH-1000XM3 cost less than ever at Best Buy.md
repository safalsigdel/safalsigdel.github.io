It's sometimes easy to dismiss the previous generation of a product in favor of the latest version. In most cases, that's smart to do, unless a deal is just too good to pass up. Case in point, Sony's WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones that released in 2018 are down to their lowest price yet at Best Buy today and through Sunday. Originally $350 (but usually selling between $220-$270 most days), you can get them new in the black colorway for $170. Amazon was offering this price earlier today, but it appears to have sold out for the moment.
