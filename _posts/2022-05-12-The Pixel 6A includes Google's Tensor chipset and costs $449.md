Google is officially announcing the Pixel 6A, which embraces the company's new design language and custom chipset but keeps the 5A's $449 price tag. The announcement comes as Google kicks off its I/O developer conference, but if you're itching to snag the new device, you'll have to wait a little while longer since it won't actually ship until July 28th. (Preorders will begin a week earlier, on July 21st.)
