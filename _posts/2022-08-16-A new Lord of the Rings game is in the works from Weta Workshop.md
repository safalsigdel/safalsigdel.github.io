Weta Workshop, which worked on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, is developing a new video game set in the Middle-earth universe from J.R.R. Tolkien's books. There aren't many details about this new game just yet — though it sounds as if Weta could have a large well of material to choose from. “Middle-earth Enterprises have licensed the literary works of the series, providing Wxc4x93txc4x81 Workshop with the broadest creative license to interpret the underlying lore of the books,” according to a press release.
