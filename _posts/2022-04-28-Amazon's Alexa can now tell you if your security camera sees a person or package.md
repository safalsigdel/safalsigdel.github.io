Alexa has always had aspirations to be a type of digital butler, and today, it's getting closer to that goal. Amazon's voice assistant can now announce when there's a person or package at your video doorbell or security camera. If you have an Echo smart display or Fire TV, it can also show you who or what is there by automatically pulling up a live video feed. The new feature will work with video doorbells and security cameras from Ring, Google Nest, and Abode, with more brands potentially adding the ability thanks to a new API from Amazon.
