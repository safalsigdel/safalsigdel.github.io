Turtle Beach announced PlayStation versions of its flagship Stealth 700 Gen 2 Max ($199.95) and the slightly less feature-filled Stealth 600 Gen 2 Max ($129.95) wireless gaming headsets. They're available to preorder now, and they'll release on October 2nd, 2022. These are almost identical to the Xbox-specific version released earlier in 2022 down to some of the same colorway options, consisting of all black with some silver accents or blue with bronze accents. But there's one big change in the newer PlayStation-specific versions that I think might actually disappoint some gamers who aren't in the know: the wireless audio transmitter isn't compatible with Xbox.
