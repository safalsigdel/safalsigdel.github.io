The new iPhone SE may look eerily familiar to anyone who has seen an iPhone in the last eight years, but as Apple has shown us with its budget line, it's what's on the inside that counts. The latest entry-level iPhone is set to come out on March 18th, with preorders going live on Friday, March 11th, and when it does it will be packing a beefy A15 Bionic processor and a slightly higher starting price of $429 with 64GB of storage. That's the same processor found in the iPhone 13 line, making the SE nearly as capable as other current iPhones. But what if you're not just shopping in Apple's world? How does a “budget” iPhone compare to Android phones within a comparable range of value?
