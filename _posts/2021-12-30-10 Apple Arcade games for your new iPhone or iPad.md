Apple Arcade is a gaming subscription service that offers a wealth of great titles with no ads for $4.99 per month. Some great new games were released for it this year, but there are also many Apple Arcade-exclusive versions of some of the biggest App Store hits, and they're just as fun as when they first came out.
