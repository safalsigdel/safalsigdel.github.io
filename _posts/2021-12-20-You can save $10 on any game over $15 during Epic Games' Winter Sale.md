This weekend, you can be sure that much of The Verge staff will be adding to their pile of PC shame. The Epic Games Store has officially kicked off its annual Winter Sale, bringing sizable discounts on fresh titles like Jurassic World Evolution 2, Battlefield 2042, and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. What's really cool though, is that Epic is discounting any title that's more than $14.99 by an additional $10. And don't sweat it too much if you're having a tough time figuring out what to buy, as the sale will be running until January 6th.
