It seems increasingly likely that Google's going to be announcing a budget Chromecast at its hardware event on October 6th, and Brazilian site Tecnoblog has posted purported pictures of the device, which the publication says showed up in documents from the National Telecommunications Agency. The device looks pretty much identical to the white model of Google's current Chromecast with Google TV, but leaks from earlier this week suggest it'll only be able to stream in 1080p instead of 4K and that it'll be around 40 percent cheaper than the current model (which is normally $50 but is currently on sale in the US for $40).
