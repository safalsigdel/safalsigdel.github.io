We're nearing the season finale of Ted Lasso (only two more new episodes!), and it seems like the show's got a lot of story threads that need to be knitted together after episode 10. Titled No Weddings and a Funeral, episode 10 was solid, but I didn't quite love it.  I'm trying to write about the episode without spoiling it, let's just say I didn't love how the session between Ted and Sharon which we've been waiting for all season was edited together with Rebecca's retelling of a traumatic event with her own father. Jason Sudeikis and Hannah Waddingham were both so great, but editing the scenes together kind of killed the dramatic momentum. But! New plot twists suggest a cliffhanger of a season finale is coming in two weeks' time. I'm ready.
