Nearly a decade after its original release, Bethesda Softworks is announcing new updates coming to its acclaimed hit Skyrim. On November 11th, exactly 10 years after its original launch date, the game is getting a free next-gen upgrade that will be available to all owners of Skyrim Special Edition. And that's not all â€” Bethesda is going to add three free pieces of Creation Club content to the game for all Special Edition owners, including the ability to go fishing.
