Smart home security company Ring is expanding the capabilities of its Ring app to add cameras that support ONVIF. The Open Network Video Interface Forum is an open standard that allows devices to communicate with each other, even if they are from different manufacturers. ONVIF-compatible cameras are generally IP-based cameras and often powered over ethernet; a common form factor is dome-shaped with the ability to pan and tilt, although there are hundreds of options.
