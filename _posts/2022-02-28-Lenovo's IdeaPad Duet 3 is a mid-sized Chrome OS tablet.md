Lenovo has announced a new Chrome OS tablet at Mobile World Congress 2022 that seems like a stellar value, along with a wave of other promising Chromebooks in its IdeaPad productivity lineup. The IdeaPad Duet 3 tablet seems to deliver more of what we liked about the 13-inch Duet 5 tablet, but smaller. It's an 11-inch tablet, which should make it easier to lug around, and to hold in your hands. Lenovo says it's the successor to the well-liked 10.1-inch Duet from 2020.
