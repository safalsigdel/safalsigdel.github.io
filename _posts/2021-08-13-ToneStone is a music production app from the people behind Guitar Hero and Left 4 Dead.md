ToneStone is an app designed to make producing music easy, even for users without any musical experience, and it's created by people who worked on Guitar Hero and Left 4 Dead. Even though the app is officially being announced today, it's still in closed beta, and there's a waitlist for those who want to try it out. As a music production hobbyist, ToneStone's interface and game-like features very much seem like my kind of jam, based on videos I've seen of the app and my conversation with founder Greg LoPiccolo.
