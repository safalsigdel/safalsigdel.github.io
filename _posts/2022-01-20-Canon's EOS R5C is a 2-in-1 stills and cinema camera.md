Canon has announced a new camera that brings cinema-grade video capabilities to a conventional full-frame mirrorless body. The EOS R5C looks a lot like the EOS R5, which in turn looked a lot like a Canon DSLR, but it's much bulkier in the back. This is to accommodate an active cooling system so it can shoot for long stretches without overheating.
