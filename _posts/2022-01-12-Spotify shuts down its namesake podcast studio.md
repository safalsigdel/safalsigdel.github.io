Spotify is disbanding its founding podcast studio and laying off some of the team. An affected employee tells The Verge that Studio 4, or Spotify Studios as it's been referenced externally, consisted of 10 to 15 employees and produced shows like Dissect and Chapo: Kingpin on Trial. Spotify called affected employees on Friday and said their last days would be January 21st. They'll receive two months' worth of severance. Some employees were reassigned while others were laid off and pointed to the Spotify job board. The studio's head, Gina Delvac, was also let go.
