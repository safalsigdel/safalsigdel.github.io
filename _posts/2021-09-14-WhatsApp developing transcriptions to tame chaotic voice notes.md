WhatsApp is developing a feature that'll offer transcriptions of received voice messages, letting you easily read what's been said without having to play it out loud. The unannounced feature was initially spotted in the service's iOS app by WABetaInfo, and WhatsApp has since confirmed that it's in the “very early stages of designing and prototyping” the functionality. It's unclear when it'll hit the WhatsApp beta for iPhone users or when it'll come to Android.
