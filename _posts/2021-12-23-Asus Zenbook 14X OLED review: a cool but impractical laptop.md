Zenbooks of this size are all usually a pretty similar deal â€” if you've used one, you've used them all. Two traits attempt to make the Zenbook 14X OLED, slated for release in early 2022, unique. The first is its OLED display, which is one of the first 90Hz OLED panels to appear in mass production. (Asus's Vivobook Pro 14 OLED, which I reviewed earlier, is another.) The second is that the touchpad is also a screen. Like, it's literally a tiny touchscreen. You can put windows down there and navigate them as you would with any other touchscreen device.
