The FBI has confirmed to The Washington Post that the agency had a license to use NSO's Pegasus spyware and that it tested out the software's capabilities. The bureau insists that the software, which is capable of silently infecting phones and accessing camera and microphone feeds, contacts, texts, and more, was never used “in support of any investigation,” but the Post's report says that there were at least discussions within the FBI and Department of Justice about how the FBI might go about deploying the spyware.
