Amazon's virtual healthcare program, Amazon Care, is now available nationwide, the company announced today. The hybrid service, which pairs virtual care with the option for an in-home nurse's visit, will be available in 20 additional cities in 2022, according to a blog post. That in-person component is already up and running in eight cities, including Seattle and Los Angeles.
