Teenage Engineering, a design company that dabbles in everything from synthesizers to helping build the Playdate gaming handheld, has made its first computer case. It's called Computer-1. It's a bold orange case that's made for mini-ITX-sized motherboards, which are reserved for small form factor builds. Like most of the company's products, it's not exactly affordable at $195. But that might not be an obstacle if you're a sucker for a case that's dripping in color and unique style.
