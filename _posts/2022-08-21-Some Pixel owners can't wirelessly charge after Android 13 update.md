Pixel owners who haven't upgraded to Android 13 yet, beware: it seems that several people aren't able to use wireless charging after installing the latest OS, which released earlier this week (via 9to5Google). There have been several posts on Reddit about the issue from people using the Pixel 4, 4 XL, 6, and 6 Pro using a variety of wireless chargers, including Google's first-party Pixel Stands. For Pixel 6 and 6 Pro owners, this could be an even bigger problem — they're not allowed to roll back to Android 12 after updating to Android 13.
