Rivian has come out with a video about the Gear Guard system for some models of the R1T, which shows off the electric pickup's ability to record video if people get too close and to send a notification to an owner's phone if there's an event significant enough to set off the car alarm. As Rivian's UX designer explains in the video, Gear Guard isn't one specific feature, but rather a suite of systems that can work together â€” the video monitoring system is part of Gear Guard, but so is the cable which you can use to lock bikes, kayaks, and more to the truck.
