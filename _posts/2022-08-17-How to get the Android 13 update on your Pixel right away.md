Google announced on August 15th, 2022, that it would begin rolling out the Android 13 update to its portfolio of Pixel devices. As is usual with Android updates, however, this doesn't mean that even if you have a qualifying Pixel device (a Pixel 4 or newer, basically),  you'll immediately see the update available. Google often takes a number of weeks to deliver the update to all devices out there.
