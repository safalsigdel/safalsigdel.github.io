Apple's next iPhones could have an improved selfie camera, with autofocus capabilities and a wider aperture, according to a prediction by well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Unlike Apple's current fixed-focus design, an autofocus-enabled front-facing camera could let the iPhone 14 take clearer pictures even if you're closer or further away from the camera. A wider aperture — Kuo predicts f/1.9 vs. the iPhone 13's f/2.2 — would add a touch of background blur and let in more light, making it slightly better for nighttime selfies or FaceTime portrait mode.
