Google Messages users in India have reported receiving a deluge of unwanted ads in recent weeks using Rich Communication Services (RCS), and Google has employed a response strategy: turn them all off. Company spokesperson Kaori Miyake confirmed to The Verge that Google has disabled the feature in India: “We are aware that some businesses are abusing our anti-spam policies to send promotional messages to users in India. We are disabling this feature in India while we work with the industry to improve the experience for users.”
