T-Mobile is announcing some updated benefits it offers to customers who subscribe to its wireless plans, which it calls “Coverage Beyond.” Perhaps the most timely is a 25 cent per gallon discount on gas at Shell stations, which it's offering via its T-Mobile Tuesday program. The company is also bringing upgrades to the international and in-flight data benefits for customers.
