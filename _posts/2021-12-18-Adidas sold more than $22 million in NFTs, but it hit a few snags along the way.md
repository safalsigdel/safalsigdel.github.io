All 30,000 of Adidas' Into the Metaverse NFTs were minted within a matter of hours of going on sale Friday. Each NFT cost 0.2 ETH, which currently equates to about $765, and the company sold 29,620 NFTs (“Adidas and partners” held onto 380 for “future events”), meaning the company earned more than $22 million from the sales in the span of an afternoon. (The price of Ethereum has been falling while writing this story, making an exact number difficult to pinpoint.)
