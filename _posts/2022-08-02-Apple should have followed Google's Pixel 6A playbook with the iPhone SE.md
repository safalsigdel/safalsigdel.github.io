There's a great phone under $500 that I'd recommend to just about anyone looking for the best midrange phone on the market. It uses the same chipset as the company's much more expensive flagships, and it includes an IP67 rating, a very good 12-megapixel camera, and a long lifespan ahead of it with software support for many years to come. It's not the iPhone SE, which I wish I could recommend as freely as the current category winner: the Pixel 6A. It's a better phone, and it's what the SE should have been. Here's what Google got right â€” and what Apple should have done differently.
