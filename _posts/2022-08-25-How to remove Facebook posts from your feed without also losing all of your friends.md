Sure, Facebook can be a great way to connect and stay in touch with family and friends. Yet, more often than not, it's a headache that can turn toxic thanks to the News Feed. Whether it's fake news, envy-inducing vacation photos from a classmate you barely know,  or a relative's upsetting political post, there are just some things better left unseen. True, you could unfollow a page if you want to stop seeing those kinds of posts, but you can't exactly unfollow your uncle or a close friend without potentially putting those relationships at risk.
