The smart home is about to change. Soon, you won't have to choose a smart light bulb or door lock just because it works with your smart speaker. Instead, you'll be able to buy a smart device, bring it home, and it will work with any voice assistant or app you choose. At least, that's the promise behind Matter, a new standard created by Samsung, Google, Apple, and Amazon. Most importantly, you won't be locked into the platform you chose. If you decide you want to switch to SmartThings from Google Home, or go with Amazon Alexa over Apple HomeKit, any Matter-enabled devices can come with you.
