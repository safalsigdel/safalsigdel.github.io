Leaked images of Google's upcoming Pixel 6 have given us our best look yet at new features coming to the search giant's next flagship smartphone. The images, which were leaked by Evan Blass, reveal shots of a second generation Pixel Stand wireless charger, user interface details, and camera specs, and include a mention of face unlock biometric security. They've arrived a little under two weeks before the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are due to be officially announced on October 19th.
