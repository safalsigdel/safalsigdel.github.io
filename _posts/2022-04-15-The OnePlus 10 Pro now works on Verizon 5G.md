The OnePlus 10 Pro officially went on sale today in the US today, and as expected, the phone has received certification to work on Verizon's 5G network just in time for new owners. That 5G support includes C-band Ultra Wideband — that good mid-band 5G spectrum that's coming online over the next few years — but not the super-fast millimeter wave (mmWave). That's no great loss; mmWave is impressively fast but has a very short range and is likewise hard to find. Realistically, C-band strikes the right balance between speed and signal range, so it's great to see it supported on the 10 Pro.
