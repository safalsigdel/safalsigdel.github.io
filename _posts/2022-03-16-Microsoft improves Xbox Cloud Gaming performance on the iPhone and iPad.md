Microsoft says it has improved the performance of its Xbox Cloud Gaming service on the iPhone and iPad. The cloud game streaming service, formerly known as xCloud, first launched fully on iOS and iPadOS nearly a year ago, accessible from the Safari web browser. While the web browser version isn't as fully featured as a dedicated app, Microsoft is now improving its performance for Apple's mobile devices despite being unable to launch a standalone xCloud app.
