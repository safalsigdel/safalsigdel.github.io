I once picked up a Chromebook that hadn't been used for a while in order to try out what was then a relatively new Chrome OS feature: virtual desktops. But when I hit the key that was supposed to bring those desktops up on my screen, I didn't see anything. I did some checking around, and I found that the feature was expected to be available as of version 77 of Chrome OS â€” several iterations after the version I was running.
