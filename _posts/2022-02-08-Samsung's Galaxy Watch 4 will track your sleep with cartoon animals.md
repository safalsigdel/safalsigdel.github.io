Samsung isn't expected to launch a new smartwatch at its Unpacked event this week, but it hasn't forgotten the Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. Starting February 9th, both smartwatches will support new health and fitness features like custom interval training, sleep coaching, and the ability to set body composition goals. Oh, and it's also promising better app compatibility for the new Wear OS platform â€” but you're still going to have to wait a bit for Google Assistant.
