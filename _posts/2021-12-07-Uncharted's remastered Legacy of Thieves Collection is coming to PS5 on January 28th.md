Sony has officially announced a release date for its remastered Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection for PlayStation 5: it'll be out on Janaury 28th. That release date is only for the PS5 version, though. Sony still hasn't put a date on the PC port beyond the same vague “2022” date it had originally announced.
