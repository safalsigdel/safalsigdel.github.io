HP's Elite Dragonfly Max is the nicest business laptop I've ever used. That doesn't mean it's the best, all things considered — when it comes to performance, battery life, and features, the Dragonfly has fierce competition from the Latitudes and ThinkPads of the world. But there's no business laptop out there that matches the elegance of a Dragonfly. It's a sleek, light, and beautiful computer — and that beauty is a big part of its hefty, hefty price tag.
