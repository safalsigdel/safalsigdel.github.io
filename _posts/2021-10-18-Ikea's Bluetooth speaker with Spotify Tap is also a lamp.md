Ikea's Vappeby Bluetooth speaker just leaked courtesy of an FCC filing. And because it's Ikea, this mushroom-shaped speaker with an IP65 rating — which means it'll resist dust, rain, and low pressure jets of water — also features an integrated 20 lumen (2700K) bulb to pull double-duty as a portable lamp.
