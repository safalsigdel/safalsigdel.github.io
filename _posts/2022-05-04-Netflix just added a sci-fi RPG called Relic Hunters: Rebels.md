Netflix is continuing to add to its steadily growing lineup of mobile games with the launch of Relic Hunters: Rebels today. The game, developed by Brazilian developer Rogue Snail, is the latest in the Relic Hunters series of colorful shooters and the first for mobile. The sci-fi RPG has a heavy emphasis on gunplay with a total of 44 different weapons to experiment with, and the studio says it was designed in part to run well on older phones. As with all other Netflix mobile games, Rebels is available for free to subscribers through Netflix's mobile apps.
