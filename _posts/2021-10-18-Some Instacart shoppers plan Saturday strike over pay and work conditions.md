Some Instacart shoppers are striking on Saturday, to protest the company's pay structure and failure to communicate directly with workers.  The Gig Workers Collective (GWC), which represent some of the company's shoppers, want the Instacart to address five of its policies. The group is calling for Instacart to pay shoppers by order instead of by batch, reintroduce its item commissions, fix fraud issues with its rating system, provide occupational death benefits, and raise the default tip for shoppers on the platform from 5 percent to 10 percent.
