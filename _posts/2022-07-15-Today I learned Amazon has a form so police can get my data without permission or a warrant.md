Here is something I didn't know when I purchased Amazon Ring cameras and Amazon Echo Dots: there is a webpage where law enforcement can fill out a form, say there's a life-threatening emergency, and get access to your data without your consent, a court order, or any kind of warrant. There's nothing in the Terms of Service about this, and the company has maintained for years that it helps police get consent first, but it's happening anyhow.
