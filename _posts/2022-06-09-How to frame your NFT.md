So let's say you bought an NFT. Not because you want to make a bunch of money and you're just going to flip it — we'll call those people the JPEG flippers — and not because someone sold you on a big idea about “community” and you didn't buy an NFT so much as a link to a Discord — those are the yacht clubbers — but you bought it because you just liked the way the thing looked. Maybe you're a collector, maybe this is the first valuable piece you've ever acquired. Either way, you bought it not to sell it or use it. You bought it to look at it. You want to hang it up in your home!
