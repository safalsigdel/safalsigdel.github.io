Apple's new MacBook Pros are here, and they may actually live up to the “Pro” moniker. But there's one big question that comes with the new sizes and processors: how's the battery life? To hear Apple tell it, it's going to be great — the company even said onstage that the 16-inch had the best battery life ever, besting last year's M1 Macs (which it also boasted would have the longest-lived batteries). But the metric Apple used to back up that claim is a bit suspect, and its other numbers tell a very different story.
