Dell has shown off a new concept device that (let's be honest) may never actually come out — but it's a lot of fun to play with. The Concept Stanza is an 11-inch tablet that's meant to simplify the process of taking notes at work. The idea is that if you write on the Stanza and then double tap your notes, they'll be instantly converted to digital text. Connect it to a computer, and your notes will show up on the big screen.
