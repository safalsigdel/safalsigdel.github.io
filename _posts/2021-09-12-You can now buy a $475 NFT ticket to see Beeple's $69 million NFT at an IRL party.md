We can all agree NFTs are kind of weird, so here's another twist to puzzle over: in November, you'll be able to see the “inaugural display” of The First 5000 Days, the collage/NFT that Beeple sold for $69 million earlier this year. You can also, obviously, view the image right now, for free, wherever you are, on whatever device you're using, by searching that title on Google. You could also pull the image up on your TV, or display it on a projector, or print it out, because that's how digital images work.
