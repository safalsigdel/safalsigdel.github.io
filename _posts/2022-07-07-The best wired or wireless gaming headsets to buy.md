If you're shopping for a gaming headset in 2022, you have a lot of options. And many of those options may soon get a big discount with Amazon Prime Day 2022 happening on Tuesday, July 12th.

Knowing a thing or two about headphones might aid in your search, but gaming headsets have only gotten more complicated to shop for â€” especially the wireless ones.
