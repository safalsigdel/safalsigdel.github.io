Motorola is working on a new version of its Razr foldable smartphones, according to a Weibo post spotted by Android Authority. The post is from Chen Jin, the general manager of the Lenovo Mobile Business Group in China (Lenovo is currently in charge of Motorola's smartphone business), and describes how the company has been quietly working on a new addition to its lineup of foldable phones. It doesn't have big shoes to fill â€” Motorola's first two modern foldables were mediocre phones with hefty price tags.
