Master & Dynamic has announced the latest addition to its distinctive lineup of true wireless earbuds. The new MW08 Sport noise-canceling earbuds are available today for $349, a $50 price increase over the standard MW08 buds released earlier this year. The extra money gets you three main benefits: wireless charging, a redesigned case with a Kevlar finish, and the addition of foam ear tips in the box. They come in black, white, blue, or green.
