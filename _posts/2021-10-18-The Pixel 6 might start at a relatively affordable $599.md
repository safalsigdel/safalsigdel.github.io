The Pixel 6's price could start at $599 with 128GB of storage, while the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro could start at $898, according to early US pricing at Target stores spotted by M. Brandon Lee and Evan Lei. Lei posted a photo of pricing already displayed on Target's shelves, while Lee has images of the retailer's inventory system showing the same prices. A “street date” for both phones (aka their release dates) is listed as October 28th.
