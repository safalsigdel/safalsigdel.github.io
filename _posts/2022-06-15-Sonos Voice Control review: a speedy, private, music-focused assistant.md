When Sonos Voice Control was announced last month, the company made it abundantly clear that its new voice assistant, free to use on all Sonos smart speakers, isn't meant to directly compete with Amazon's Alexa or the Google Assistant. Sonos lacks the size and resources to build any smart assistant that could go toe to toe with the scope of those existing Big Tech platforms. Instead, the company went and bought a voice assistant startup called Snips and remained laser-focused on what it's good at: music. Sonos Voice Control's sole purpose is controlling audio playback across the various Sonos speakers around your home.
