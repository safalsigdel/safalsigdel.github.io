We knew from the beginning that Valve's upcoming $400 Steam Deck handheld wouldn't play every Steam game perfectly out of the box. It runs Windows games on Linux using the Proton compatibility layer, and some of the biggest games on Steam use anti-cheat software that, historically, hasn't worked with Proton.
