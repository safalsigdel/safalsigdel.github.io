Elon Musk expects to pay over $11 billion in taxes in 2021, the Tesla CEO said in a tweet. The figure is roughly in line with a report from CNBC last week, when it estimated that Musk has already paid $7 billion in state and federal taxes this year, and will pay a further $5 billion by January 1st. CNBC said the figures could represent “the single largest tax bill ever.”
