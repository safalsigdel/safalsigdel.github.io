If you can't get your hands on a new GPU right now, you could at least have a miniature version sitting at your fingertips. As seen via Tom's Hardware, a new custom keycap in the form of an Asus ROG Strix brand GPU is now on sale in China. It replaces the right-shift key on your keyboard and comes with three miniature spinning cooling fans (though, sadly, there are no tiny customizable LED lights).
