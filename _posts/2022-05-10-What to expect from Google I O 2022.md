Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O, is scheduled to take place this week, kicking off with an opening presentation on Wednesday, May 11th, at 1PM ET. Although the conference itself is pitched at helping developers get the most out of Google's tools and platforms, the keynote is relevant for a much broader audience, with hardware and software announcements for products due for release in the next 12 months.
