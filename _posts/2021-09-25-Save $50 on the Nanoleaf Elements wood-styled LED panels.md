Kicking things off are the Nanoleaf Elements light-up wall panels, which are currently seeing a nice discount at Best Buy. A seven-piece kit of the hexagon-shaped panels is $50 off right now, bringing them down to $250. If you want to go beyond seven, you can opt for a three-panel expansion kit for $80 (saving you $20). These panels are customizable, too, and you can connect up to 22 of them in one contiguous pattern.
