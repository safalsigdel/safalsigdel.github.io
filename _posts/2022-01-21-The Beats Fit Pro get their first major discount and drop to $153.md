Time and time again, we see Apple AirPods and AirPods Pro wireless earbuds getting frequent discounts and deals. In general, if you want to buy any pair of true wireless earbuds — with active noise cancellation or without — you should be able to find a deal somewhere. One holdout that has been elusive up to now was the Beats Fit Pro. These latest models from Apple-owned Beats came out in late 2021 and surprised us with how good they are — even besting the AirPods Pro in the sound quality department. They have held steady at their $199.99 price point the whole time, but now they finally see a discount of about $50.
