Epic is starting up another sales promotion for PC games available through its Epic Games Store. The Epic Mega Sale runs from today until June 16th at 11AM ET / 8AM PT and encompasses an unlimited-use 25 percent off digital coupon. This coupon stacks on top of ongoing sale prices, though you can't use it on titles priced below $14.99. Epic is also releasing four free mystery games each Thursday during the promotional period, the first of which is Borderlands 3.
