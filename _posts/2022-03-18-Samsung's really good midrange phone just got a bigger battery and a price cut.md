Last spring, Samsung announced a trio of Galaxy A-series phones that were all destined for US retailers' shelves. This year, it's promising just one new model for US customers: the Galaxy A53 5G. It offers some modest upgrades, which is fine because the A52 5G was a really good phone. But its best new feature is a $50 lower price tag, which at $449 for 128GB of storage, puts it juuuuust under Apple's $479 iPhone SE with 128GB. Maybe that's a coincidence! Probably not! Also debuting today is the Galaxy A33 5G, coming to markets outside the US with largely similar specs.
