The barrier to entry for SteelSeries' flagship wireless gaming headset, the Nova Pro Wireless, is quite high at $350. That price will likely be worth it to some people, but if you're cool with getting just a fraction of that headset's features in a $179.99 package, the Nova 7 Wireless has your name on it. It's missing swappable batteries, active noise cancellation, and the handy wireless base station for making quick adjustments. But it keeps some of the Nova Pro Wireless' most important features, like the simultaneous multisource audio coming in from Bluetooth and its 2.4GHz USB-C audio transmitter.
