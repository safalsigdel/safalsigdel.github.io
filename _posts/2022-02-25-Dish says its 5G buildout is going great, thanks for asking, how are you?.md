Remember when you were signing up for a new phone plan and you considered options from four major wireless carriers? You don't â€” at least, not if you were shopping around in the last couple of years. In the US, we only have three major carriers while Dish Network is in the process of building what is supposed to be our fourth option. That's the agreement that was reached in the wake of the T-Mobile / Sprint merger, and the company is running up against a Federal Communications Commission-imposed requirement to cover 20 percent of the population by June 2022. So how's that going? Just fine, according to Dish, even though its 2021 Q4 earnings call today didn't paint the rosiest picture of its current state.
