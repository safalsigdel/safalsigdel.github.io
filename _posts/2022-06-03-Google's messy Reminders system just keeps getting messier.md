Google appears to be dropping two features from its Assistant's reminder-setting capabilities. It's ditching support for assignable reminders — “remind Anna to bring in the trash cans this morning” — and location-based ones — “remind me to call Becca when I get to the office.” Google didn't announce either change, instead opting to bury one in a support page and another in a pop-up in the Assistant app. Both features still work but evidently won't for much longer.
