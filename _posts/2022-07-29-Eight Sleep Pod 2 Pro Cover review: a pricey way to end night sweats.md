I can't remember a time when I haven't been lectured about the importance of a good night's rest. Tragically, getting an uninterrupted eight hours of sleep feels like an elusive goal only attainable by children, surly teenagers, pets, and annoying health influencers. In my house, the bed is a battlefield between me, my cat, my dog, and my spouse — each of us with our own temperature preferences, schedules, and sleep issues. We've tried a whole host of sleep tech gadgets to improve the situation to little avail. So I was hopeful but skeptical that the temperature-regulating Eight Sleep Pod 2 Pro Cover ($1,895 as tested) would make a noticeable difference.
