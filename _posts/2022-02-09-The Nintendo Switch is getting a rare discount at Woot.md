The regular price for the standard Nintendo Switch is $299.99, but Woot is currently offering a rare discount on this popular handheld, lowering the price to $279.99 for Amazon Prime members. The standard Switch comes packaged with a pair of Joycons and a charging dock to connect the console with your TV. While the Switch does come equipped with built-in storage of 32GB, that space can go pretty quick with the number of titles available for this console. Besides being home to first-party Nintendo titles featuring Mario and Zelda, the Switch eShop is chock full of amazing indie titles like Shovel Knight and Hades.
