Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition became unavailable on the Rockstar Games store the same day it launched. The Trilogy, which comes packaged with the remastered versions of GTA III, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas, was supposed to be playable on November 11th, but due to maintenance and other issues, it's been anything but that.
