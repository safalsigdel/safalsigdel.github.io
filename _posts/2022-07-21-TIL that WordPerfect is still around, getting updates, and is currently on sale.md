Recently my colleagues and I were discussing the history of word processors (that's just the kind of thing we do here), and a few of them reminisced about using one called WordPerfect many, many years ago. Given that its heyday was in the eighties, I hadn't heard much about it, so I Googled it for fun. And that's when I discovered that it's still being sold as a productivity suite. What's more, it's not one of those cases where a company is still taking money for what's essentially abandonware â€” the most recent release is WordPerfect 2021. As in a year ago. And it's on sale.
