One of the cool new features in iOS 16, the latest version of Apple's OS, is called Live Text, which allows you to quickly capture and use text from both a still photo and, now, a video as well. While Android doesn't (yet) capture text directly from video, it does capture text from still photos using the handy Google Lens app â€” and with a little bit of maneuvering, you can use Lens to capture text from a video as well. It may not be quite as quick as Live Text, but it's mostly painless and works just as well.
