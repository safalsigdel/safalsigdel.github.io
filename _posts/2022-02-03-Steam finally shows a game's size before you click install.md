Valve is starting to let Steam users see the size of a game before they attempt to install it. Library pages of games will finally list the total space required for a game, without having to first click install to see the disk space details and estimated download time. It's a minor change that's rolling out as part of a beta update to Steam this week, meaning it should be live for all Steam users in the coming weeks.
