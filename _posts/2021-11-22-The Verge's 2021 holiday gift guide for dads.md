It's not an easy task to do holiday shopping for the people who you're closest to, especially for the dad in your life. Not all dads are the same, mind you, but they can be tough to please in the gift department because they might already buy themselves everything they want, thus keeping a clean slate of a wishlist at all times. Or, maybe they're tough because what they find enjoyment in is really niche, and you fear that you won't get them something they'll actually enjoy. No one wants that.
