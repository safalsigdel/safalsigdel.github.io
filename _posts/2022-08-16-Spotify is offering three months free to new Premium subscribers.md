Spotify is offering three free months of service for new Spotify Premium users. The three-month offer is available for new individual and student subscribers, while new Spotify Duo and family subscribers can receive one free month. The offer isn't available to former Premium members, but Spotify is giving those who canceled before July 15th a chance to revamp their subscription at a steep discount, receiving their first three months for $9.99.
