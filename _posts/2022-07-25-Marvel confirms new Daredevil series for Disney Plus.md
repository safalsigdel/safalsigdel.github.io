Now it's official: a new live-action Daredevil series is coming to Disney Plus. The news was first reported earlier this year, but at Comic-Con this evening Marvel confirmed the series' existence. It will be called Daredevil: Born Again, and will once again star Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio as Daredevil and the Kingpin. The show is expected to hit Disney Plus in the spring of 2024.
