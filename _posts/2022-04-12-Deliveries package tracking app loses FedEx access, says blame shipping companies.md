The developer of Deliveries, a package tracking app that's listed as an App Store editor's choice and that some people here at The Verge rely on, has said that they're “no longer able to maintain the same service” thanks to a lack of support from delivery companies. In an April 5th post written by developer Mike Piontek, the company says that “Deliveries relies on many different shipping companies, and without their help it's not possible for the app to continue working the way you expect.”
