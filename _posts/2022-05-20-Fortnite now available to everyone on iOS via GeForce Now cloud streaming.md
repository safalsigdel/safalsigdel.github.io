After four months in closed beta, a touchscreen-optimized version of Fortnite is now available to stream via Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud gaming service on iOS and Android. It means iPhone users have another workaround to play one of the most popular games in the world after it was unceremoniously booted from the App Store in August 2020 for bypassing Apple's in-app payment system. On iOS, GeForce Now is available via the browser, while Android owners can access it via an app.
