We saw some of the best iPad deals of the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but if you missed out, there are still a couple of decent discounts available. Whether you're after the high-end iPad Pro or the most affordable Apple tablet, the entry-level iPad, there's a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. Of course, it's difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you're looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that's often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we've listed each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements.
