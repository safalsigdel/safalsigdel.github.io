A new report has uncovered compatibility issues with version 2.0 of the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) standard that means older USI 1.0 styluses won't work with some newer USI 2.0 devices. ChromeUnboxed came across the problem while using Lenovo's new Chromebook Duet 3, when it noticed that existing styluses weren't working with the device.
