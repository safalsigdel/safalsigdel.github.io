eBay now lets you get a 360-degree look at some of the sneakers it has for sale, all thanks to its handy new 3D viewing tool, called eBay 3D true view. In a post on eBay's website, the e-commerce platform said that the feature will let sellers add interactive images of their sneakers to listings. It's partnering with Unity, a platform that can be used for real-time 3D modeling, to pilot the feature.
