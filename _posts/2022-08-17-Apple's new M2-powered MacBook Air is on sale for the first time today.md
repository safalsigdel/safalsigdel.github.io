Heading back to school soon? If you're in the market for a new laptop, you can save $100 on Apple's new M2-powered MacBook Air, which is our top pick for most people when it comes to laptops. It's a relatively small discount, yet it's also the first we've seen on the new MacBook, which launched only last month. Right now, you can buy the “starlight” model at Amazon and B&H Photo with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, an eight-core CPU, and a 30W power brick for $1,099.
