If you've been working from home, but haven't invested in a standing desk yet, you're in luck. Right now, Fully is running a promotion until March 21st that knocks 15 percent off the price of many of its popular standing desks. The Jarvis bamboo-topped standing desk, its most popular model and a favorite among several staffers here at The Verge, is currently discounted to $509.15, compared to its typical starting price of $599.99.
