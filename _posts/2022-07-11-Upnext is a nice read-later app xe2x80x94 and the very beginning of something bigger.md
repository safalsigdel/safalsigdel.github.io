Upnext is a read-later app. No, it's a bookmarking app. No, it's a content-curation-social-network thing. Even Jeroen Seghers, one of the service's co-founders, struggles to explain it. “Longer term,” he says, “I like to think about what we're building as a knowledge browser.” But even he admits that doesn't mean much to anyone right now. Eventually, Upnext settled on “A reader with superpowers,” which is close enough.
