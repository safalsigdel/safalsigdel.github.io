Expect to see plenty of great deals on 4K TVs as we get ever closer to Black Friday at the end of the month. But one of those must-see deals is happening today at Best Buy. The latest version of Hisense's 55-inch U7G Series TV normally costs $850, but the retailer is selling it for $650 while also throwing in three months free of Apple TV Plus. The TV comes equipped with a 120Hz panel with support for Dolby Vision, HDR 10, and HDR10 Plus. Google Assistant is available right out of the box, as are major streaming apps, including YouTube, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and more.
