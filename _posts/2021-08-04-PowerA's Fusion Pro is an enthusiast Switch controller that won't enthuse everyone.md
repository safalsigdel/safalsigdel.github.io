PowerA's $99.99 Fusion Pro for the Nintendo Switch is made for gamers who want a more customizable controller. It's more similar to Microsoft's Xbox Elite than Nintendo's Switch Pro gamepad, with a handful of components you can physically swap out to better fit your preferences. For instance, if you don't like the way that the Fusion Pro's analog sticks feel out of the box, you're welcome to swap them. There are two extra sticks in the zip-up case that it ships in. In addition to the two standard sticks, there's a much taller concave stick, as well as a tall smooth convex stick that feels more like something you might find on an arcade stick.
