Regular listeners to Decoder know I'm pretty skeptical of crypto. But I want to come by that skepticism honestly, so I talk to people who are actually investing in and building crypto startups and technology. There is a lot of money, attention, and energy — both literal and metaphorical — in crypto, and I think it's important to ask the questions and really listen to the answers. We've done a few of these episodes now, but this episode is a conversation I've wanted to have from the very beginning.
