During the “Pixel Fall Launch” event, Google formally launched the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro as well as its Pixel Pass. Beyond that, however, the tech giant didn't divulge much more about other new products — like Google's first folding phone. Google previously confirmed in 2019 it's working on prototyping foldable device technology, has applied for patents on foldable screens, and we've since reported on a number of leaks suggesting the Pixel Fold might arrive as soon as this year.
