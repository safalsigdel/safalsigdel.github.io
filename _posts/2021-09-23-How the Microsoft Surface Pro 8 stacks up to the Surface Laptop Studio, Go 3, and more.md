At its recent hardware event, Microsoft refreshed almost its entire lineup of Surface products (sorry, Surface Book, but you're sitting this one out). The company showed off the new Surface Pro 8, the Go 3, and it capped off the proceedings with details about its interesting and transforming Surface Laptop Studio. There was more at the event, like the Wi-Fi version of the Pro X, as well as the Surface Duo 2 folding phone. Here are all of the biggest announcements if you wanted to see them in one place.
