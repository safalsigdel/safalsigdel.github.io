If you're on the hunt for a budget-friendly OLED TV, one of the best values at this moment is Gigabyte's 48-inch Aorus FO48U OLED. It costs $800 at Newegg (via Slickdeals), but two steps are required to get this price. First off, enter the code FEB4SALE at the checkout page to knock $200 off the cost. You'll pay $999.99 today. But make sure you fill out the mail-in rebate before March 29th, 2022, which will then take an additional $200 off (the rebate will come in the form of a prepaid card).
