Grab the second-gen Apple AirPods at Walmart for just $89, matching the lowest price we've seen for these earbuds. This model normally costs around $120 and doesn't include the wireless charging case. This model of the ubiquitous white earbuds wasn't a big step forward compared to the first iteration, but our reviewer was still happy with their wireless performance and overall reliability.
