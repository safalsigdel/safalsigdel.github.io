Luke Ross* has a hard time telling friends what he does for a living. He can't quite believe it himself. “I'm a kid with a fake steering wheel in the backseat who pretends to know where they're going,” he tells The Verge. In 2020, he released a free mod for one of the most popular video games, Grand Theft Auto V, that lets you play the entire game in VR. Now, thousands of people pay him every month to stick their heads into some of their favorite video game worlds.
