Now that the dust has settled from Apple's “Peek Performance” event, we know that the latest entry in the iPhone lineup is the iPhone SE (2022). It's a new iteration of the budget model from 2020, and it's set to launch March 18th with preorders opening on March 11th. This new iPhone SE rounds out the entry-level offering from Apple, coming in at a slightly higher price of $429 (an increase of $30) and equipped with the latest A15 Bionic CPU, 5G compatibility, a slightly larger battery, and more durable glass on the front and rear.
