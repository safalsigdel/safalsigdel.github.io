Sony is the latest video game company to put on a big virtual event, and its PlayStation Showcase 2021 didn't disappoint. It was a chance to show off some of the biggest games coming to the PS5, and while there were some notable absences — Sony still isn't talking much about the next generation of PlayStation VR — we were able to catch a glimpse of highly-anticipated titles like God of War: Ragnarok, Spider-Man 2, and a remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. There were even a few surprises, like a new Wolverine game.
