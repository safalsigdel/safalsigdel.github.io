The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Activision Blizzard have settled a lawsuit over the games company's allegedly pervasive sexual harassment and discrimination. The news follows an EEOC suit filed Monday in California court that was based on a three-year investigation including cooperation from the games publisher. As part of the settlement, Activision Blizzard will create an $18 million fund to compensate employees who claim damages.
