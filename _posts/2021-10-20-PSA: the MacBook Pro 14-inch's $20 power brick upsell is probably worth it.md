If you're looking at buying the $1,999 base model MacBook Pro 14-inch, there's one upgrade that you may really want to make â€” the $20 one that gets you the 96W power adapter instead of the 67W included power adapter. That's because, according to some wording on Apple's MacBook Pro configuration page (spotted by MacRumors), you'll need the more powerful charger if you want to take advantage of the computer's fast charging feature, which can charge the laptop up to 50 percent in half an hour.
