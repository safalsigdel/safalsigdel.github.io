Shure has expanded its headphone lineup with the release of the new Aonic 40. The Aonic 40 are a set of wireless over-ear headphones with adjustable active noise cancellation, Environment Mode, 40mm composite drivers, USB-C quick charging, and an estimated 25 hours of battery life with ANC turned on. Priced at $249, this new model sits below the current $299 Aonic 50 in Shure's lineup — which earned a nod in The Verge's best noise-canceling headphones of 2021 — and shares some features like a user-customizable EQ through the ShurePlus Play app.
