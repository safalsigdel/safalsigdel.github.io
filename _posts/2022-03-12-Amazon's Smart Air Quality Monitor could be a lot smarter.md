Amazon's $69.99 Smart Air Quality Monitor is the company's first foray into the increasingly popular category of indoor air quality monitors (IAQs). And, based on my experience with the product, it's a bandwagon-jumping move. While relatively inexpensive and helpful thanks to voice control, the Smart Monitor doesn't add anything particularly innovative or useful to the concept of a consumer air quality monitor.
