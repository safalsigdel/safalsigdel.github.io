Epic Games announced Wednesday that there are now more than 500 million Epic Games accounts. It's a notable milestone as Epic continues to build the Epic Games Store as a competitor to Steam and bring in new players for titles like Fortnite and Rocket League. Epic didn't share further details about that 500 million, however, so it's unclear how many of those accounts represent segments like people that only play Epic's own games (such as Fortnite) or those who have only used Epic's store.
