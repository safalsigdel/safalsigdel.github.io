Spotify's Car Thing, the dashboard accessory that controls Spotify on your phone, is now widely available to buy in the US, the company announced today. The accessory was first made available free of charge as part of an invite-only limited release last April, and in October Spotify opened up a waitlist for people to get their hands on the device. Now, Car Thing is going on general sale for $89.99 â€” a $10 increase over the advertised price in October.
