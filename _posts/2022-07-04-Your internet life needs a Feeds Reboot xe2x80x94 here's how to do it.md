For the last few years, I've chosen one weekend day a year to undertake what I've come to call a Feeds Reboot. I try to systematically go through every subscription, every follow, every algorithmically or chronologically generated thing I see on social platforms, streaming services, and news apps, and reset or at least review the way it works. I can't recommend this enough.
