Google has announced that cars with its services built-in will be getting the ability to play YouTube videos while parked later this year, starting with Volvo. For those with a V90, XC40 Recharge, or other supported cars, this should make waiting in a parking lot more bearable since you'll be able to see videos on your car's built-in screen, which is probably going to be slightly larger and more ergonomic than a phone.
