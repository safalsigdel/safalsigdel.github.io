A bad update to Chrome OS, version 91.0.4472.165, has left some users unable to log in to their accounts, or reportedly with boot-looping computers (via Android Central). If you've found yourself locked out of your Chromebook, help is on the way: Google posted on its system status page that it's working on a fix, which it expects to release on Wednesday. It's also pulled the update, which should prevent more users from experiencing the issue.
