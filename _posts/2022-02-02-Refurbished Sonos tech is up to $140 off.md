Sonos deals can be hard to come by, but right now, you can save a lot of money if you don't mind buying products refurbished. Sonos is currently discounting a range of its items, including the latest generation of the Sonos One, which at $149 is $70 cheaper than its $218 retail cost when purchased new. If you want a Sonos speaker that you can use at home or portably as a powerful Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-enabled speaker, check out the Move, which costs $319 through Sonos' refurb store (usually $399).
