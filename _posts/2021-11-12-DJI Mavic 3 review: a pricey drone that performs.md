DJI may have a wide range of drones in its portfolio, but it's the Mavic line that symbolizes the beginning of a new era for DJI drones. With the latest Mavic 3, DJI is introducing dual camera systems with hybrid zoom lenses, built-in SSDs, ability to shoot ProRes video, and better autonomous features. It's a blend of pro-focused photo and video features with an easy-to-fly and easy-to-transport drone.
