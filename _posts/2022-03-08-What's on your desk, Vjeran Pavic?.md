Video is an important part of The Verge, and Vjeran Pavic is an important part of our video team. His official title is senior video director; for the most part, he's the one behind the lens creating videos and photos for our site. He is also (unofficially) our in-house drone expert. His workspace at home is deceptively simple; we asked him for a tour.
