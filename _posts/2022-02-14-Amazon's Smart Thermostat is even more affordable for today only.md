At $59.99, Amazon's Smart Thermostat is among the most affordable options out there that can intelligently tweak the temperature of your home and take voice commands via Alexa. But today's deal at Amazon, Target, and Best Buy knocks $12 off of that price, and $47.99 matches the best deal we've seen on this smart home gadget yet. And just because it's cheap doesn't mean it's lacking in features or quality. My colleague Jennifer Pattison Tuohy called it “a $60 stunner” in her review, praising its clean design and smart features that live up to their promises.
