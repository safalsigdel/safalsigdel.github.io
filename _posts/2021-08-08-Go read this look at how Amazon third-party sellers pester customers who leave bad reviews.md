When you buy something on Amazon, the e-commerce giant isn't always the one making the sale; an estimated half of all products sold on Amazon come from third-party sellers. Amazon says it's merely the conduit between buyer and seller, and doesn't bear responsibility if a third-party product is defective (although some recent court cases have challenged that stance).
