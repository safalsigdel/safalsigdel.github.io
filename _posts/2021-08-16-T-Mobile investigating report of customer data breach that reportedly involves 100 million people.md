T-Mobile confirmed Sunday that it's looking into an online forum post that claims to be selling a large trove of its customers' sensitive data. Motherboard reported that it was in contact with the seller of the data, who said they had taken data from T-Mobile's servers that included Social Security numbers, names, addresses, and driver license information related to more than 100 million people. After reviewing samples of the data, Motherboard reported it appeared authentic.
