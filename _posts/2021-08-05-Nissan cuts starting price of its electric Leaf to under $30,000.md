Nissan's Leaf 2022 range starts at just $27,400, making it the cheapest mass market electric car currently available in the US, according to Electrek. That starting price drops to as little as $19,900 if you include the full $7,500 federal tax credit, for which Nissan vehicles are still eligible. These prices don't include other charges like licensing and destination fees, or additional state-level incentives, but it's a promising sign of how affordable electric vehicles are becoming.
