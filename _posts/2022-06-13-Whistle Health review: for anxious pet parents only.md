When it comes to my own health, I'm not a hypochondriac. But if we're talking about Daisy, my 4.5-pound, 17-year-old Yorkie? Every sneeze, every meal she doesn't finish, or any time she loses a fight that she started with our 18-pound cat â€” I'm convinced she's embarking on her inevitable journey across the rainbow bridge. In 2020, I outfitted her with the Whistle Go, a fitness tracker for pets, to encourage her to walk at least 10 minutes a day. It did not go as I'd planned. Two years later, I haven't learned my lesson. For the past two weeks, Daisy has been rocking the $44.95 Whistle Health on her collar.
