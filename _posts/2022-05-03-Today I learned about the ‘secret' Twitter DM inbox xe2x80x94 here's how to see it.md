Today I learned about a secret cache of Twitter DMs that's hidden behind a privacy setting. For some people, this means uncovering a trove of important messages that they've missed out on, but if you're like me, the discovery of a “hidden” inbox wasn't all that exciting. In either case, it's still worth checking to see if you might have any messages Twitter blocked you from viewing.
