It looks like Samsung's next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S22 Ultra, will borrow more heavily from the Galaxy Note's DNA than ever before. In fact, a newly leaked official render published by Evan Blass confirms that the phone is pretty much a Note in every way except for its name. Wider screen with more surface to write on? Check. S Pen silo? Check. Flat top and bottom? Yep. Around back is a camera array that sticks closely to the layout from the S21 Ultra.
