Astell & Kern's latest portable music player is as high-tech as it is extravagantly expensive. The $2,399 A&ultima SP2000T releases in October, and it stands out from the brand's previous models like the Kann and Kann Cube with a new triple amp system. These things are never affordable, and the price might seem especially out there if you're content with listening to music from a streaming service on your phone. But there's some real engineering swagger in effect here.
