Ford Mustang Mach-E owners will seemingly soon have another option for planning out a route: Apple Maps' long-awaited EV routing (via 9to5Mac). It's understandable if that feature doesn't ring a bell — Apple announced it at WWDC 2020, saying that it'd be coming to BMW and Ford cars with iOS 14, but it's mostly been silent about it since.
