I didn't much care for Aloy, the main character of Horizon Forbidden West. I think she's the least interesting person in the cast of characters who surround her, and her serious-yet-aloof nature doesn't really endear her to me. And though the world Horizon presents is intriguing, the story constructed for it falls victim to some late-game twists that defy explanation. And yet, despite being less than enamored with the story and characters, the thing I primarily play video games for, I willingly and enthusiastically spent 64 hours across two weeks hunting, exploring, crafting, and fighting and would happily do so again.
