Apple is introducing an option to fully disable Night Mode on an iPhone camera in iOS 15. While you've always been able to turn off Night Mode for a particular shot, the iPhone camera will also re-enable it the next time it detects it needs to be used. In iOS 15, you can now toggle whether the camera remembers Night Mode has been turned off.
