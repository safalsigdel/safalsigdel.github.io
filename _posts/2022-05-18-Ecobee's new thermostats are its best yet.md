Ecobee has announced two new smart thermostats â€” the first since the Ecobee SmartThermostat with Voice Control arrived in 2019 and the first new products to launch since the company was bought by generator giant Generac last fall. The $249.99 Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium and the $189.99 Ecobee Smart Thermostat Enhanced join the Ecobee3 Lite (now priced at $149.99) in Ecobee's lineup. Both new models are available now at ecobee.com, Amazon, Lowe's, Home Depot, and Best Buy.
