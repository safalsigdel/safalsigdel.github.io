Amazon is once again expanding its lineup of Echo Show smart displays, and this time, it's going bigger. The new $249.99 Echo Show 15 is the largest smart display the company has released so far, with a 15-inch, 1080p HD display. It's also got a different design than the company's prior models â€” instead of being a touchscreen attached to a bulky speaker, the Echo Show 15 is flat and can be hung on the wall.
