People always look at me weirdly when I say that I use Samsung's Galaxy Buds Live with my iPhone 12 Pro. But it's a pairing that makes sense for me: First, I need something that sits entirely within my ear, without a stem that's going to risk being knocked about by a bike helmet's strap. Second, they work with Samsung's companion Galaxy Buds app on iOS, so I can still access their advanced features. And third? I just love that they're shaped like little kidney beans.
