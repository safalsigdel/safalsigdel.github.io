Elgato's latest external capture card is the HD60 X. It's priced at $199.99, like the HD60 S Plus before it, but features an updated design that sees its HDMI and USB ports all placed on its rear to keep cable clutter to a minimum. It can capture up to 4K 30fps HDR. 1440p 60fps SDR, or 1080p 60fps HDR, and pass through up to 4K 60fps HDR, 1440p 120fps SDR, or 1080p 240fps SDR. If high frame rates are your priority, then it's possible to capture up to 120fps in 1080p by scaling down 1080p 240fps footage.
