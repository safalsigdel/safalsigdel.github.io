The Oculus Quest 2 standalone VR headset is a great value at its regular $299.99 price. It comes with 128GB of onboard storage, and once you log in with your Facebook account, there's little else standing in your way of finding some amazing virtual reality experiences and games. It's even more of an appealing holiday gift idea right now because you can get one with a $50 gift card tossed in at no extra charge through Black Friday until Tuesday, November 27th. Several retailers are honoring this promotion, including Best Buy, Amazon (enter OCULUS50 at checkout), Newegg, Costco, Target, and Oculus itself.
