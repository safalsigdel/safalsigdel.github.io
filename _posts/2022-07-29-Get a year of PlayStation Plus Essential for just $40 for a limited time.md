If you're one of the lucky ones who have managed to nab a PlayStation 5, you'll be pleased to hear that luck is once again working in your favor. Right now, Verge readers can buy a year of PlayStation Plus Essential service from Eneba for around $40 instead of $59.99 when they use promo code VERGEssentials at checkout. Note that the price might fluctuate by a few dollars and cents on Eneba's website, but the final sale price at checkout should be under $40.
