Amazon is making a bunch of changes to the Alexa user experience, all with the same idea in mind: making the virtual assistant easier to use. The most notable is a change in how Alexa handles Routines, which developers can now create and recommend to users instead of requiring you to manually build your own automations. Alexa's also starting to coexist with other manufacturers' assistants, and Amazon is working to make sure that the most important commands — like “Stop!” — work no matter what wake word you're using.
