As the inaugural class of Clubhouse's “Creator First” program, they were supposed to receive Clubhouse's help landing sponsorships and turning their shows into a “profitable creative endeavor.” The creators wrote down lists of brands they wanted to speak with and prepared one-sheets pitching their live audio shows.
