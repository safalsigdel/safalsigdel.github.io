Audi built a special S1 E-Tron Quattro, dubbed the “Hoonitron,” in December for American precision driver Ken Block. And now, the automaker is set to bring the EV to US soil this month during Monterey Car Week. It'll be juxtaposed with its design inspiration: the 1985 Audi Sport Quattro S1 that rally driver Walter Rxc3xb6hrl set a Pikes Peak International Hill Climb record with in 1987.
