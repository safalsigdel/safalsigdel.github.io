The official range estimates for the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck are in, and they're looking pretty good. The base model, which starts at $39,974, will get around 230 miles of range, while the extended range versions start in the mid-$50,000s and can go about 320 miles â€” or about 20 additional miles than originally expected.
