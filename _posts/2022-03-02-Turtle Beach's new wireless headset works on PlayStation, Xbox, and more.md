Turtle Beach has announced the Stealth 600 Gen 2 Max, a new $129.99 wireless headset that's one of a few models out there that can work with Xbox and a myriad of other platforms. Typically, you get compatibility with Xbox or with other platforms like PlayStation, PC, and the Nintendo Switch's dock, but not both. This headset's included USB-A audio transmitter has a switch that can toggle wireless modes, ensuring compatibility no matter which system you're on. It's worth noting that SteelSeries offered a similar feature with its Arctis 1 Wireless headset back in early 2020 (albeit with a fancier USB-C dongle), but it's still generally difficult to find a headset that can accomplish this feat.
