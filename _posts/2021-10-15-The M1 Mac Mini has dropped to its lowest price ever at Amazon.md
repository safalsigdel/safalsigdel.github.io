The Mac Mini is already Apple's most affordable desktop computer, which makes today's discount an even better deal. Right now, you can grab the 2020 Mac Mini with 512GB of storage and 8GB of RAM for its lowest price to date. Typically $899, Amazon is currently taking $150 off in total and bringing the price down to $750, a discount you'll see at checkout. Note, however, that the 256GB version is also on sale for $600 instead of its typical $700.
