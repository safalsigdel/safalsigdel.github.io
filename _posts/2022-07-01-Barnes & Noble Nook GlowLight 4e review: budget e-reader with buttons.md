For years, the only practical alternative e-reader to Amazon's Kindle was a Kobo. But after a long time away, Barnes & Noble is back in the game with its new GlowLight 4 e-readers. The company recently released the $119.99 Nook GlowLight 4e, the budget-friendly version of the $149.99 Nook Glowlight 4 introduced in December. With its physical page-turning buttons, USB-C support, and 212dpi resolution, this new entry-level model seems like a strong contender.
