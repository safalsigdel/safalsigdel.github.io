Valve is making a big change to the way developers can market their games on Steam. Beginning September 1st, graphical assets developers use in their store listings will only be able to include game artwork, the game's name, and any official subtitle. Images won't be able to include review scores, award names or logos, text that markets discounts, or text promoting a different product.
