Intel is building what it claims is the “largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet” in Ohio, and it's going to need 7,000 workers to construct it, according to a report from the Associated Press. However, a labor shortage affecting the construction industry could make it hard to recruit the workers it needs for the $20 billion job, and competition for workers could slow the pace of homebuilding in the area which is needed to support the growing workforce that Intel's plant is supposed to attract.
