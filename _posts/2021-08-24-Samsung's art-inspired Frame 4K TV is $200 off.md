The Frame, Samsung's HDR-compatible QLED that pulls double duty as wall art, is one of the more unique TV designs that didn't die in the concept phase or on the showroom floor of CES. Designed to look like a framed and matted photograph, the 120Hz screen hides in plain sight when switched to an Art Mode that displays still imagery instead of a black void when turned off. It's a stunner of a TV in many ways and, for a limited time, Best Buy and Amazon are offering the 55-inch model for $200 off, the second-lowest price we've seen this year on the high-tech piece of home decor. It's the perfect way to convince your friends you're a person of culture and refinement while still being a techie nerd who loves large screens.
