Oculus is rolling out its v31 software update to Quest and Quest 2 headsets starting today, and it's filled with some nice quality-of-life improvements. The big one is it'll be easier to invite friends and recent teammates who aren't friends to play a game or experience an app together. When you're in game or in app, pressing the Oculus button will pull up the universal menu as usual, but soon, more apps will show a new “Invite to App” button next to the “Resume” and “Quit” buttons. If friends accept your invite, you'll be able to see them in the menu. This feature will roll out soon in games like Beat Saber, Blaston, Demeo, Echo VR, ForeVR Bowl, Hyper Dash, PokerStars VR, and Topgolf with Pro Putt.
