Our review of the Dell G5 15 SE cemented it as one of our favorite gaming laptops of last year. More than a year later, however, this laptop still packs plenty of power and its most powerful configuration is available at Dell for just $900. While Dell's gaming laptops typically use Intel-based architecture, the G15 SE instead relies entirely on AMD hardware. A Ryzen 7 4800H CPU capable of delivering speeds up to 4.2 GHz and a 6GB RX 5600M GPU deliver excellent performance for 1080p gaming. While we weren't thrilled with the aesthetics of this laptop, we couldn't argue with the overall performance.
