It's not every day that you get sizable discounts on products that just came out, but today is an exception. The new Eero Pro 6E mesh Wi-Fi router, which The Verge's Jennifer Pattison Tuohy just reviewed, is already on sale at Amazon for 15 percent off. It's the new, top-of-the-line model from Eero, sporting a 6GHz band that eclipses gigabit speeds via Wi-Fi â€” at least in devices that support it. It's also got Thread support for easier smart home integration with compatible products, and the signal from one unit can cover up to 2,000 square feet. These mesh routers also come in a two-pack to cover 4,000 square feet or a three-pack for big, multi-floored homes.
