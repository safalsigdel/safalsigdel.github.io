Alex Heath is deputy editor at The Verge who works with our creators team and covers Meta along with the social media industry more broadly. Covering Meta in-depth has also led him to cover augmented and virtual reality. He's also the co-host of the newest season of Land of the Giants, Vox Media's narrative podcast series on the tech giants. This season is, of course, all about Meta.
