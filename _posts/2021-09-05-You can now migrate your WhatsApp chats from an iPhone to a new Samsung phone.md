WhatsApp has added the ability for users to migrate their chat history when switching from iOS to Samsung Android devices, the company said in a blog post. Samsung announced the feature was coming during its August Unpacked event, and addresses one of the more frustrating features — or lack of— of WhatsApp on mobile devices. Previously, if users selected WhatsApp's cloud backup feature, then iOS chat histories were stored in iCloud, while Android's histories backed up to Google Drive, making it almost impossible to transfer chats between phones that weren't running the same operating system.
