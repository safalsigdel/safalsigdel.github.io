In the vast underground office of Lumon, the megacorporation at the heart of Apple TV Plus' thriller Severance, the computers are downright bizarre. At first they look a bit like an old Mac, but the closer you look, the more strange they become. The CRT display is somehow a touchscreen. The beautiful blue keyboard is saddled with a gigantic trackball. The goal, production designer Jeremy Hindle tells The Verge, was to design a device that doesn't make a lot of sense, mirroring the purgatory-like world that exists only within Lumon's basement. “The idea was that anything you could see underground doesn't exist up top anywhere,” says Hindle. “You'll never see that computer or that keyboard.”
