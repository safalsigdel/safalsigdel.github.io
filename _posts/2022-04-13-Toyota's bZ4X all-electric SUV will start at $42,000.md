Toyota announced that its bZ4X electric SUV will have an MSRP of $42,000 for the base, front-wheel-drive version, with the “Limited” all-wheel-drive version starting at $48,780. The memorably named vehicle is Toyota's first full EV and will go on sale in “spring, 2022” — though the company's site notes that availability will be “extremely limited” (emphasis Toyota's) as Toyota struggles to keep up production amidst supply chain constraints.
