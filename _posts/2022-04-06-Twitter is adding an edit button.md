It's a feature that Twitter users have been requesting for so long that it's become a meme, but now the mythical “edit button” is actually becoming a reality. Twitter has announced that it's working to allow users to edit their tweets after posting them. The idea is that you'll be able to fix any typos or errors in a tweet without sacrificing any replies, retweets, or likes it's already accrued. Twitter plans to begin testing the feature with Twitter Blue subscribers in “the coming months,” the company said Tuesday.
