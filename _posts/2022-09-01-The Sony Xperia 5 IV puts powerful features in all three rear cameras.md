Sony is renewing its “compact” phone for another season with the announcement of the Xperia 5 IV. It's a step down from the 1 IV in size, price, and features but shares the same emphasis on parity across its camera system. That means all three of the phone's rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — include the company's excellent Real-time Eye AF for better portraits and are capable of super-fast burst shooting speeds even with HDR enabled. It has other flagship specs to back up its camera features, too, and comes with an equally flagship-y price: $999.
