The Super Bowl is less than a week away, which means you only have a few more days to take advantage of the streaming device deals currently available (and receive your purchase on time). Right now, you can pick up what we consider to be the best streaming device on the market, the Chromecast with Google TV, at a discount. Normally $49.99, it's on sale at Best Buy, Target, Adorama, and Walmart for $39.99, matching its lowest price to date.
