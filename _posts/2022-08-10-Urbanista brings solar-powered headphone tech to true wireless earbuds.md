Urbanista is following up its solar-powered over-ear headphones from last year with a pair of solar-powered true wireless earbuds called the Phoenix, the company officially announced today. Like the headphones, Phoenix uses Powerfoyle solar panels produced by Exeger to extend their battery life with power from the sun's rays. But unlike the Los Angeles headphones that have solar panels built into the headband, the panels aren't included on the Phoenix earbuds themselves. Instead, they're built into the Phoenix charging case.
