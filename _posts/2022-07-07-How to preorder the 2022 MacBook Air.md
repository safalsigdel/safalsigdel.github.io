Apple's 2022 MacBook Air with an updated design, M2 processor, MagSafe charging, and a slightly bigger display will soon be available for preorder, starting at $1,199. Apple says it will open preorders online tomorrow, July 8th, at 8AM ET / 5AM PT, and orders will begin shipping Friday, July 15th. If you have a hard time preordering online for delivery (preorders don't typically sell out, but ship dates often get pushed back very quickly), here's a tip: try to order online right at 8AM ET on launch day, July 15th, with your order set as an in-store pickup.
