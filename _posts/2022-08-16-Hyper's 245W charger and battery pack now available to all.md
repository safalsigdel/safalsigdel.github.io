After initially crowdfunding them via an Indiegogo campaign, the HyperJuice 245W GaN Desktop Charger charger and the 245W USB-C Battery Pack are now generally available for $200 and $250, respectively. Judging from this story from AppleInsider it looks like both quietly went on sale last week, but Hyper's official announcement is somewhat confusingly dated both August 15th and August 8th.
