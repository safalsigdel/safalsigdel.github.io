Turtle Beach is known primarily for making gaming headsets, but it recently launched its first controller called the Recon for the Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC. It's a $59.99 wired model available in black or white that doesn't feel all that different from Microsoft's wireless controller. What little it does change design-wise is ultimately successful, and I'll get into all of that shortly. But I want to focus first on the Recon's killer feature: customization.
