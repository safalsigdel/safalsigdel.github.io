Sony released a ten-minute-long trailer for The Last of Us Part 1 on Thursday, where the game's directors talk through some of the improvements coming in the PlayStation 5 remake of Naughty Dog's iconic game. The trailer takes plenty of opportunities to show off the improved graphics (which look as nice as they have in the leaked screenshots, but it's not like the game was ugly on the PS3 or PS4), but the most interesting involve changes to the gameplay â€” Naughty Dog says that the AI for enemies and companions will be improved, that there will be some extra gameplay modes, and that the game's cutscenes will have audio descriptions for accessibility.
