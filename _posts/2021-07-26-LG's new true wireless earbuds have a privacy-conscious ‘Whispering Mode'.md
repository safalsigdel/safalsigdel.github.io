LG's new Tone Free FP true wireless earbuds feature a “Whispering Mode” where you can hold the right earbud next to your mouth during calls to use it as a dedicated microphone. It's a neat privacy-conscious feature for those moments when you don't want to have to speak loudly enough for the sound to be picked up by the earbuds in your ears.
