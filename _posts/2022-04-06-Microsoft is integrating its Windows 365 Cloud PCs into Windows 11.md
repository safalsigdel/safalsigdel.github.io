Microsoft put PCs in the cloud with Windows 365 last year, and now it's integrating these Cloud PCs directly into Windows 11. Windows 365 lets businesses access Cloud PCs from anywhere to stream a version of Windows 10 or Windows 11 inside a web browser. It's something Citrix and many others have been doing for years, but now Microsoft will allow Windows 11 PCs to boot straight to Windows 365 Cloud PCs or easily switch between them using Windows 11's virtual desktops feature.
