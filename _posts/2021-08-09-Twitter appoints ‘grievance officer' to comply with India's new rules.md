Twitter has appointed two new executives in India in an attempt to comply with the country's new information technology laws, a company lawyer told the Delhi High court at a Friday hearing. First reported by Bloomberg, one of the new executives is a chief compliance officer who will also serve as grievance officer, and the other is a nodal officer, both required by the country's Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code which took effect in May.
