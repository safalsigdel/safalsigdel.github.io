Firefox 95, the latest version of Mozilla's browser that's rolling out starting today, introduces a new security feature that's designed to limit the damage that bugs and security vulnerabilities in its code can cause, Mozilla announced today. The feature, called RLBox, was developed with help from researchers at the University of California San Diego and the University of Texas, and it was originally released as a prototype last year. It's coming to both the desktop and mobile versions of Firefox.
