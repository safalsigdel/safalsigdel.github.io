As Eero's latest top-of-the-line mesh Wi-Fi router, the tri-band Eero Pro 6E ($299 to $699) is another leap forward in home Wi-Fi for the company that popularized mesh Wi-Fi systems. And the Pro 6E certainly delivers. I saw significantly faster speeds over the previous generation Eero Pro 6 in my tests. But I also saw some network drop-offs, which Eero says is an issue around the Thread implementation â€” a key part of support for the coming smart home standard Matter that Eero has committed to. The overall increased speed is thanks to the new 6GHz Wi-Fi band and some extra 160MHz channels on the 5GHz band. While 6GHz devices are still few and far between, lots of devices can take advantage of the 160MHz channels, and I saw speed boosts on all devices, not just those that could use the new band.
