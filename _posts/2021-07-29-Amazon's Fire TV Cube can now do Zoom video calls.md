Amazon has announced that its second-gen Fire TV Cube is now able to participate in two-way Zoom video calls. The company rolled out support for videoconferencing between the Fire TV Cube and Alexa smart displays late last year, but Zoom opens up even more possibilities for hosting virtual chats or work calls on the biggest screen in your home. This really would've come in handy over the last year, but better late than never, I guess â€” and it should still prove convenient for anyone working a hybrid office / home schedule in the months ahead.
