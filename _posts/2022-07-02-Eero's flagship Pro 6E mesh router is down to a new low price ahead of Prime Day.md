This Friday, our deals deliver some Wi-Fi gains. If you're in the market for a fast mesh Wi-Fi router or an upgrade to your existing one, then you've got some discounted options from Eero right now. Amazon-owned Eero is running a pre-Prime Day sale that drops its latest and greatest models to their lowest prices until July 11th for Prime members. Will these early Prime Day deals pale in comparison to the discounts when Prime Day actually lands on the 12th and 13th? We'll find out together soon enough, but these deals are too good not to share with you now.
