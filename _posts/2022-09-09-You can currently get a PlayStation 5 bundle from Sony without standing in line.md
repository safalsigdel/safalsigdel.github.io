Today, Sony's giving those who have yet to land a PlayStation 5 another chance. Sony is once again selling the PlayStation 5 Horizon Forbidden West bundle for $549.99, which comes with the disc-based console and a digital code to download a copy of Horizon Forbidden West. But unlike Sony's more recent restock events, you don't need to enter an online queue to check out â€” just log in with your PlayStation Network and check out (seriously).
