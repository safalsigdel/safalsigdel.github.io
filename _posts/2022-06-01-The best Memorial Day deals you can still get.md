Memorial Day marks the unofficial start to summer in the US. In addition to using the long weekend of the national holiday for travel and taking some well-earned rest and relaxation, it usually kick-starts lots of outdoor activities â€” like backyard cookouts, road trips to the beach, and camping trips. It's also another shopping holiday, with discounts on offer for all kinds of home goods and some great tech, gadgets, and gear.
