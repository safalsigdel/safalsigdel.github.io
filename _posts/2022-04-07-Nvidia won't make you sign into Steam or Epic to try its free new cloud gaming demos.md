Cloud gaming isn't for everyone, but it's getting easier to tell if it's for you because Nvidia and Google are now letting you try their virtual gaming PCs for free. Following Google's recent announcement that any Stadia developer will be able to offer an instantly accessible free trial of their game without needing to log into a Google account, Nvidia's GeForce Now is now pushing reduced-friction demos as well â€” starting with Chorus, Ghostrunner, Inscryption, Diplomacy Is Not an Option and The Riftbreaker: Prologue.
