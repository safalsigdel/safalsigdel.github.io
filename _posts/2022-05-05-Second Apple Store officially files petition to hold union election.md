Employees at Apple's Towson Town Center store in Maryland have officially filed a request to hold a union election with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), according to Dave DiMaria, an organizer with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW). The store is the second to do so. In April, employees from an Apple Store in Atlanta filed their own petition to hold a union election, which Apple recently agreed to. That vote is set to start on June 2nd.
