Apple is challenging antitrust action taken by Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), which wants iOS developers to be able to tell customers about alternatives to Apple's in-app payment option, Reuters reports. Apple wants a judicial review of the regulator's warning, Russia Today notes, which was originally issued with a deadline of September 30th for the US tech giant to change its anti-steering policies. When Apple didn't comply, FAS announced it was opening an antitrust case against the company at the end of October.
