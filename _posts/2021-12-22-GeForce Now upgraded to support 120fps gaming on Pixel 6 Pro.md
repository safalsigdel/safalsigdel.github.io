Pixel 6 Pro owners just got another reason to give Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud game streaming service a shot. The service can now stream games at 120fps on Google's latest flagship smartphone, according to a recently updated support page spotted by XDA Developers. It's unclear when the update rolled out exactly, but it means games should feel smoother and more responsive to play compared to when they were capped at 60fps.
