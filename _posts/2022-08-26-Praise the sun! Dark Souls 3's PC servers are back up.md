According to tweets from FromSoftware Player Support and the official Dark Souls Twitter account, the PC servers for Dark Souls 3 have been restored after being taken offline since early January. The servers were initially disabled by FromSoftware to prevent a malicious remote code execution (RCE) exploit that allowed hackers to take control of players' computers. FromSoftware has been working to patch its servers and restore service ever since, and it seems that for one game, the time has finally arrived.
