If your TV's built-in speakers are just not cutting it, a soundbar like Vizio's M-Series 5.1.2 can considerably amp up the sound quality. This particular Vizio soundbar is one of our favorites, offering a full Dolby Atmos soundbar system for a more immersive surround sound experience for far less than $500. The Bluetooth-equipped soundbar comes with a 6-inch wireless subwoofer, a backlit remote control, and two wired, upfiring rear speakers, which replicate the kind of sound you might expect to hear from in-ceiling speakers. Other companies would usually require you to buy these separately, making this system a great value for your money â€” especially today, as it's just $349.99 at GameStop. That is a $150 discount and a new all-time low.
