Joining an army of OLED laptops that have launched this month is Lenovo's new IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon (branded as the Yoga Slim 7 Carbon outside of North America). Lenovo claims it's the lightest 14-inch OLED laptop on the market at 2.37 pounds. (I'm guessing the company is right. The closest competitor I can think of is Asus' ZenBook 14X OLED, which is 3.09 pounds. It's also lighter than both the ZenBook 13 OLED and the Dell XPS 13 OLED.)
