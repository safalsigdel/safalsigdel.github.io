Peloton's numbers don't look great. In its Q4 2022 earnings release this morning, the company reported a $1.2 billion operating loss, a 28 percent revenue drop, a membership decline, and a monthly subscriber churn exceeding 1 percent for the first time in a long while. (Perhaps ever?) And that's just the tip of the iceberg. In a nutshell, losses were greater than both Peloton and investors had anticipated.
