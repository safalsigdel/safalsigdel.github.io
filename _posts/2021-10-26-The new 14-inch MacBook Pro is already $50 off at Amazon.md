Last week, Apple introduced its new generation of MacBook Pro laptops, featuring a new design (complete with a notched screen) and faster M1 chips. If you had your eye on the 14-inch model instead of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, you can save just a little bit of cash on it when you preorder at Amazon. The configuration that has the M1 Pro chip (eight-core CPU, 14-core GPU), 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is $1,949.99 instead of $2,000. A $50 discount isn't a whole lot, but it's something.
