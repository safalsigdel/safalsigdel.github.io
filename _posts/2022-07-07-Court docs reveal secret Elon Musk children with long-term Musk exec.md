According to a report by Business Insider, Elon Musk is the father of twin children with current Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis. Business Insider shared a court document from this May with Zilis and Musk petitioning for a name change for both children, making “the children's last name to be their father's, and for their mother's last name to be contained in their middle name.” CNN Business obtained a Travis County, Texas, court docket showing the petition was filed in April 2022 and obtained in May.
