Activision Blizzard has confirmed Diablo Immortal won't be launching in Belgium and the Netherlands alongside other countries on June 2nd, and has blamed the territories' “current operating environments” for preventing the release of its new free-to-play title, Eurogamer reports. The two countries are notable for recent rulings taken against loot boxes in games, with authorities in each country arguing that they constitute a form of gambling. The cancellation was first reported by Dutch news site Tweakers.
