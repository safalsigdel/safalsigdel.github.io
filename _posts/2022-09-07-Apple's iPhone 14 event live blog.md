It's time for Apple's annual September event, and this should be a big one: we're expecting iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and plenty of models between them. The event, which Apple's calling “Far Out,” kicks off today, September 7th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. It's streaming live for anyone who wants to tune in remotely, but Apple is also holding an in-person component from its campus in Cupertino — and we'll be there, reporting live.
