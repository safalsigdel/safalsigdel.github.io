An update to Tumblr's iOS app censors a long list of tags to comply with Apple's strict safety guidelines. The platform explains that it's changing iOS users' ability to access sensitive content, affecting their experience when it comes to searching for content, scrolling through the “Stuff for You” and “Following” sections of the dashboard, and could even prevent access to blogs that are flagged. Tumblr says it has to “extend the definition of what sensitive content is” to “remain available within Apple's App Store,” and it seems that Tumblr stretched it pretty far.
