Gogoro is the latest EV company to jump on the trend of going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. The Taiwanese e-scooter and battery-swapping tech startup announced Thursday that it will combine with a SPAC called Poema Global Holdings, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The deal — which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 — will net Gogoro around $550 million, and will value the startup at more than $2.3 billion.
