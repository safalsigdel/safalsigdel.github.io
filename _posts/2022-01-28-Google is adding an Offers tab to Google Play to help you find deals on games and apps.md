Google is adding an “Offers” tab to the Google Play app that's intended to help you find deals on games and apps, the company announced Thursday. Google says the Offers tab will include things like sales on games and in-game items, rewards and bundled offers, discounts on movies and books, and apps offering free trials. The new tab launches this week with a rollout that's “underway,” and Google says it will be available to “more people in the United States, India and Indonesia over the coming weeks, and more countries later in 2022.”
