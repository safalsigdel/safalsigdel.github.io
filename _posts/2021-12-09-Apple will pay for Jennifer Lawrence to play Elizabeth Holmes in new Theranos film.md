Apple says it will produce a movie about former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, with Jennifer Lawrence of Hunger Games fame in the starring role. The movie, to be directed by Succession creator Adam McKay, will be based on the bestselling book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by former Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou. He wrote the first news stories detailing Theranos' problems, even as the company and Holmes were being lauded in Silicon Valley.
