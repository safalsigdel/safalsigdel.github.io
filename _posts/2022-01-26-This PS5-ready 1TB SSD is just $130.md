Not all M.2 SSDs are PS5-compatible. They need to be PCIe 4.0-ready and boast a 5,500MB/s read speed (though some slower drives may work, according to our testing), and Adata's XPG Gammix S70 Blade meets those requirements. The reason why I'm telling you about this one, in particular, is that it's selling for just $129.99 at Best Buy and Amazon, a $30 price cut. At that price, it's one of the fastest yet most affordable ways to add storage to your PS5. Similar models from brands like Samsung often sell for about $50 more than this.
