Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics has released a holiday video featuring its dog-like Spot robot, and it's turned out as creepy as ever. The video, posted to Twitter, starts innocuously enough â€” there's a large present of the type anyone would be happy to see under their tree, sitting in a courtyard. Then, the gift stands up and walks off-screen, kind of like Metal Gear's Solid Snake moving through a jungle disguised as a cardboard box to stalk a private military contractor.
