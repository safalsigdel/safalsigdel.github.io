MSI has made a number of updates to the Summit Series, its line of high-end business laptops. The Summit E14 Evo, Summit E13 Flip Evo, Summit E16 Flip Evo, and Summit E16 Flip (which is similar to the Flip Evo with a higher-resolution screen and discrete GPU options). There's also a brand-new model, the Summit E14 Flip Evo, which is a convertible version (meaning its screen can fold backward into a tablet shape) of the Summit E14 Evo. Interestingly, the 15-inch Summit E15 does not appear to have been updated.
