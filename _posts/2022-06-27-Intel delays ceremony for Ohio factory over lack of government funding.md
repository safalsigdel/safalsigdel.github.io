Intel is postponing the groundbreaking ceremony for its planned chip-making facilities in Ohio because the US government hasn't yet provided it with funding, the company confirmed to The Verge (via The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal). The ceremony, which was originally set to take place on July 22nd, has been delayed indefinitely in a likely bid to push the US government towards passing the CHIPS Act.
