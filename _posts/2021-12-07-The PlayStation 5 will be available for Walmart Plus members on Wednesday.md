Ready. Steady. Go. If you're still looking for a PlayStation 5, Walmart Plus members will be able to queue up for the console beginning at 12PM EST on Wednesday, December 8th. Walmart will open the digital queue for the standard Playstation 5 ($500) and the disc-less, digital-only version ($400). This paywall doesn't necessarily improve your chances of snagging a console but is currently the only way to be in the running at this particular retailer.
