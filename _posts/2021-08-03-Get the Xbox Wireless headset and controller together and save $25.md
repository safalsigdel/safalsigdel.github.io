Online retailer Antonline is hosting bundles that include Microsoft's Xbox Wireless Headset and one of the new first-party Xbox wireless controllers for $25 less than it'd cost to purchase each item separately. There's a bundle with the headset paired with a pulse red controller, a shock blue controller, and one with an electric volt controller. Each are selling for $140 right now, and Antonline suggests acting fast as it told us that deals including this headset tend to sell out quickly.
