Ring is releasing some holiday-themed Quick Replies to add some cheer to its doorbell's automatic answering feature. Instead of the usual “We can't answer the door right now, but if you'd like to leave a message, you can do it now” types of messages, you can instead have your Ring greet visitors by saying “We're busy wrapping presents right now,” or have it automatically thank delivery workers for bringing gifts to your door.
