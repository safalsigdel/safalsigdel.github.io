As is usually the case for CES, there is an abundance of gaming laptops being announced for release in early and mid-2022 that have at least two of the following traits in common: they have Intel's 12th Gen H-series processors, or they support AMD's Ryzen 6000-series processors, and they have Nvidia's new RTX 3070 Ti or RTX 3080 Ti graphics chips. What's more, many of them will also support DDR5 RAM at 4,800MHz. It's a great time to be shopping for a laptop, as these seem faster than ever.
