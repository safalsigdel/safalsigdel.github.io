The new and very good iPhone 13 Pro lineup has a thicker camera bump than previous generations (7.65mm vs. 7.4mm in the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max). It sounds negligible, but it's enough to cause a few small issues with accessory compatibility. For instance, the iPhone 13 Pro apparently doesn't fit perfectly onto the MagSafe Duo dual charger because of its size. And based on my colleague Sam Byford's first-hand experience, it also doesn't fit all that well when placed inside of the Backbone One, the best iOS controller you can currently buy.
