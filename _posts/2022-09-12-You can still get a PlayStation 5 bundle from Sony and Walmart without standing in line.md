If you haven't been able to land Sony's next-gen console yet, both Sony and Walmart are currently offering up another chance. Sony is once again selling the PlayStation 5 Horizon Forbidden West Bundle for $549.99, while Walmart is selling the same configuration for $549. If you're not familiar with the package, the apt-titled Horizon Forbidden West Bundle comes with the disc-based PS5 as well as a digital code to download a copy of Guerrilla Games' excellent Horizon Forbidden West. Best of all, unlike Sony's recent restock events, you don't need to enter an online queue to check out at either retailer â€” just log in with your PlayStation Network ID or Walmart credentials and check out (seriously).
