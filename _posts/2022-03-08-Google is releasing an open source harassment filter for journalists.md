Google's Jigsaw unit is releasing the code for an open source anti-harassment tool called Harassment Manager. The tool, intended for journalists and other public figures, employs Jigsaw's Perspective API to let users sort through potentially abusive comments on social media platforms starting with Twitter. It's debuting as source code for developers to build on, then being launched as a functional application for Thomson Reuters Foundation journalists in June.
