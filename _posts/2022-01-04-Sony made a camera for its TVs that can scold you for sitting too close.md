Here's the so-called “weird Sony” gadget for CES 2022: the Bravia Cam is a new video camera that will come bundled with the company's very fanciest TVs (like the new QD-OLED A95K) and sold as an optional add-on for the rest of the lineup. You'll be able to make video calls with it, but Sony is cramming in way more functionality than the simple stuff. The question is really whether any of the Bravia Cam's many tricks will actually work worth a damn in the real world.
