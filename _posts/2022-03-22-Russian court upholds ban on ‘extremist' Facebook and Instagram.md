A judge in the Tverskoy Court of Moscow has ruled to ban Meta based on Facebook and Instagram for engaging in “extremist activities,” as initially reported by Russian state-owned media outlet TASS. Judge Olga Solopova said “The court has ruled to grant the Russian Prosecutor General's Office's lawsuit,” according to Interfax. The ban will block Meta from doing business or opening new branches in the country and will take effect “immediately.” It doesn't include WhatsApp.
