As reported by Light Reading and confirmed to The Verge, T-Mobile has committed to a June 30, 2022 shutdown date for Sprint's LTE network. It's an expected move as T-Mobile continues to absorb Sprint's network and customers into its own base, and comes six months after its contentious planned January 1, 2022 shutdown of Sprint's 3G CDMA network.
