Planning on flying out for a holiday this summer? Trying to unwind on a packed flight while a baby screams like a banshee isn't the most relaxing start to a vacation â€” and is exactly when a pair of noise-canceling earbuds could come in handy. Unfortunately, many tend to be over $100, but today you can buy 1More's ComfoBuds Pro on Amazon in white for $55 instead of $94.99 or in black for $59.99 as opposed to $99.99, both of which require you to clip the on-page coupon.
