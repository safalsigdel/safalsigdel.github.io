After 15 years of the iPhone's existence, the clownfish wallpaper from Apple's infamous 2007 presentation is finally making its way to the devices â€” at least for some developers running the latest iOS 16 build. Twitter user Jack Roberts shed light on the wallpaper, sharing a screen capture of the Clownfish option under the Collections section in iOS 16 Beta 3. The tweet then gained large attention after it was retweeted by Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman.
