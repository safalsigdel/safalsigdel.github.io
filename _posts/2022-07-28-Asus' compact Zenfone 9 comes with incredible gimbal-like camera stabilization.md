The Zenfone 9, like last year's 8, is that rare Android phone that prioritizes compact size rather than maximizing screen or battery size. Be still my heart! But the new story this year is the phone's camera and stabilization system: rather than just moving a single lens element to compensate for camera shake, the entire main camera — lens, sensor, all of it — moves. It's a unique approach to fighting some of mobile photography's biggest enemies: low light and shaky video footage.
