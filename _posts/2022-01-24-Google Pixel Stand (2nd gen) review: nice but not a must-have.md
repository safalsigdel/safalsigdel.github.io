The latest Google Pixel Stand is less of a “must-have” accessory if you're a Pixel phone owner and more of a “nice to have.” For $79, its primary job is fast wireless charging, and it does that well. But unless you're a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro owner and you're really sold on one of the stand's handful of extra features supported by your phone, then you'd be better off saving your money and getting an inexpensive third-party charger.
