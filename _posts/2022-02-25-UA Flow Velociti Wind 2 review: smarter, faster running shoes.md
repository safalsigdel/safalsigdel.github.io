When you google “best running shoes,” you're not going to find Under Armour at the top of many lists. That's usually reserved for Brooks, Hoka, Saucony, Nike, New Balance, and a few other specialty brands. But there's one thing Under Armour's got that these other well-established brands don't — a line of connected running shoes. The latest is the $160 Under Armour Flow Velociti Wind 2, and as you might guess from the name, it's meant to help you run faster.
