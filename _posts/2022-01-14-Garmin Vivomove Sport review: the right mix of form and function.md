In theory, hybrid smartwatches should offer the best of analog design and modern technology â€” something sleek and beautiful on the wrist but capable of discreetly tracking your health and delivering notifications. In practice, companies tend to put a premium on that chic design, leaving you with a smartwatch that's not as functional as others in its price range. But Garmin's entry-level Vivomove Sport is affordable at $179.99, with a design and feature set that matches the price. Finally, it feels like we're getting somewhere.
