The theme of today's Verge Deals roundup is that, well, there is no theme. We're just a few weeks out from Amazon's Prime Day extravaganza, happening on July 12th and 13th, and it's typical to see a relative calm before the storm of deals arrives. Why not kick things off today with a stellar deal on some already inexpensive true wireless earbuds? Anker's Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro (in black) are just $99.99 at Best Buy as part of the retailer's deal of the day. They normally cost $169.99, and normal sale prices typically sit around $130.
