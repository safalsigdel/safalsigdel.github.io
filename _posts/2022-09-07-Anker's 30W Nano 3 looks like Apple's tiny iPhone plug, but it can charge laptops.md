Anker's making its smallest charger even smaller and cheaper at $22.99. The new Anker 511 Nano 3 charger is a 30-watt single USB-C charger that's designed for fast charging an iPhone or iPad and can even power a MacBook Air â€” all with a charger that's about the size of Apple's old 5W charger it used to include with iPhones.
