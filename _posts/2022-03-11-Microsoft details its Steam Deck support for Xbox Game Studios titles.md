Microsoft is providing an update on its support for Valve's Steam Deck today. Most Xbox Game Studios titles will run on the Steam Deck, but Microsoft says Gears 5, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Halo Infinite, and Microsoft Flight Simulator X are unsupported. These titles don't work on the Steam Deck due to anti-cheat systems, and it's not clear if they'll ever be supported in the future.
