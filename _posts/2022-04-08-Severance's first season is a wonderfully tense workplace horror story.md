In the age of binge-watching and television seasons that drop all at once, Severance feels unique: it's a show you definitely don't want to watch in one go. Despite the veneer of a banal workplace drama, Severance is an incredibly tense sci-fi horror series where that tension only builds over the course of the show's nine episodes. Each new chapter is a chance to see something more messed up and discover the dark depths the capitalist machine is willing to sink to. You're going to want some space in between to let it all soak in â€” and maybe catch your breath a little.
