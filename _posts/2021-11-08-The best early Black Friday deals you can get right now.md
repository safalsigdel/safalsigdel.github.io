Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we're already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year's most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, some retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple's AirPods to LG's C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them have price-matching policies that guarantee you'll get the lowest price. Below we've compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.
