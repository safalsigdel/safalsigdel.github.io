The OnePlus Nord 2 CE is the latest entry in the company's more affordable Nord range. It's a stripped-down version of last year's Nord 2, similar to the original Nord CE. The CE stands for “Core Edition,” similar to Samsung's FE or “Fan Edition” devices. It costs xc2xa3299 (xe2x82xac349) and will be available in Europe and India (but not the US). It'll be available to pre-order from March 3rd and will go on general sale on March 10th in Europe. Check out our full review right here.
