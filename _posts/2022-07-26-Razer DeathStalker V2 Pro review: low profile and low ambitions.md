The DeathStalker V2 Pro is a redesign of Razer's original DeathStalker gaming keyboard, which used membrane switches and chiclet keycaps. While the V2 Pro may share a name with the 10-year-old keyboard, little else has remained the same. The V2 Pro is a full-size, low-profile keyboard that incorporates a shorter version of Razer's optical switches that are available in linear or clicky varieties. It also features 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth connectivity for anyone who prefers a wireless setup or wants to quickly swap inputs between devices.
