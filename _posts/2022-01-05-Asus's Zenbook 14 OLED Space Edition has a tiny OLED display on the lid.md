Asus's line of ultraportable Zenbooks can be hard to distinguish from one another. There are a ton of them, and they all offer a similar look and a similar package. That's certainly not the case with the new Zenbook 14 OLED Space Edition, which is designed to look like a spaceship. There's a tiny 3.5-inch OLED display on the lid, which displays various cute space-themed animations, and there are various space-related engravings (including some Morse code) throughout the chassis. I'm not sure how practical of a purchase it will be (especially since Asus hasn't announced the price yet), but it's always nice to see companies stepping out of the box with creative designs.
