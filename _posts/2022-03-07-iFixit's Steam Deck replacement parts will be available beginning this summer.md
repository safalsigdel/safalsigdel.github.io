iFixit plans to start offering Steam Deck replacement parts this summer, iFixit's Kevin Purdy tells The Verge. Valve first announced in February that the repair experts at iFixit would be one of the authorized sellers of replacement parts but did not give a specific timeline as to when they would be available. The vast majority of consoles aren't easily user repairable, so making official Steam Deck replacement parts available, even if they aren't out just yet, is a good thing for consumers. And hopefully, it will push other hardware makers to do the same in the future.
