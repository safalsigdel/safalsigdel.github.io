Samsung is making good on its promise from CES 2022 to bring NFTs to its TVs, by announcing a partnership with NFT auction site Nifty Gateway. In a press release, Nifty Gateway says that it's “now integrated with Samsung's NFT platform,” letting you “browse, display, and interact with NFTs” on the company's “2022 premium TV product lines such as QLED and Neo QLED TV.” Nifty Gateway will also have an app on Samsung's The Frame and Micro LED TVs.
