T-Mobile has announced a new plan for its 5G home internet service, which won't require applicants to undergo a credit check. The prepaid service will carry T-Mobile's Metro branding, and customers will be able to sign up for it at Metro retail locations. This brings a prepaid option to T-Mobile's $50 a month service, which doesn't have any data caps or contracts, which could be appealing to users who don't have great internet options available from traditional ISPs.
