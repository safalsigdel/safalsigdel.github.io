Walmart doesn't want a lack of know-how to prevent its customers from buying smart home tech, TVs, and other devices that require installation or assembly. A new partnership with in-home services provider Angi has been announced to help mount TVs, set up smart air conditioners, and complete other DIY projects around your home. Angi says over 150 “common home projects” will be available to order from nearly 4,000 Walmart stores, as well as Walmart's website.
