The remnants of Sprint's network have been put out to pasture. As of yesterday, Sprint's LTE network has been retired by its new owner, T-Mobile. That's along with Sprint's 3G CDMA network, which was shut down earlier this year, and what remained of T-Mobile's own 3G network, which enters retirement today. T-Mobile spokesperson Justin Paulsen confirmed to The Verge that the network shutdowns are now underway.
