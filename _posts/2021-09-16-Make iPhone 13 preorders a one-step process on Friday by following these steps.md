If you're planning on preordering one of Apple's new iPhone 13 models at 8AM ET on Friday, September 17th, you might be interested to know that Apple says customers can pre-register their details to make the checkout process a little easier. Now, before you say anything, I completely agree that the idea of pre-registering for a preorder sounds ridiculous. But if you're someone who wants to complete the preorder as quickly as possible to guarantee an early ship date during a time of global component shortages, it's a useful trick to know. Just be aware that this process is only available until midnight on Thursday, Eastern Time.
