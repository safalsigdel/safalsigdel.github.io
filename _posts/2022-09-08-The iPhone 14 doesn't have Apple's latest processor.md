Apple has announced that the regular iPhone won't be getting a new processor this year — instead, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will be powered by Apple's A15 Bionic chip, the same chip that's in the iPhone 13 Pro — though it does have a bit more grunt than the A15 that was in the regular iPhone 13 and the $429 iPhone SE from earlier this year, thanks to an extra GPU core. This is the first time that Apple's not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone.
