Twitter has announced that it's testing new accessibility features to make alt text descriptions significantly more useful and prominent for everyone on the platform. With the change, images that have descriptions will be given a badge that says “alt,” and clicking on that badge will show the description. The change has been a long time coming, but that's not necessarily a surprise — Twitter didn't have a dedicated accessibility team until 2020.
