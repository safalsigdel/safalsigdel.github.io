At CES 2022, the company announced that it intends to launch a Razer Smart Home app for mobile, which it says is a “simple, yet powerful tool that puts complete, unified control into the user's hands.” With it, Razer plans to make it easier to set up, customize, and sync all of your lights, regardless of the manufacturer.
