Amazon has announced a tool that will give sellers access to information about what shoppers are currently looking for and help make it easier to choose which products to create next. Amazon calls it the Product Opportunity Explorer and says that it'll give sellers access to data and trends that will help them “identify opportunities to launch new, high-potential products to serve unmet customer demand.”
