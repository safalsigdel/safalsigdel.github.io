Today, Sonos and Ikea officially announced the second-generation Symfonisk table lamp speaker. The Verge previously reported that the product was in the pipeline, and its design, which is now more customizable and comes in different styles, leaked earlier this month. The new Symfonisk lamp will be available in Ikea's US stores, US website, and “select markets in Europe” starting October 12th. It'll expand to all of Ikea's markets in 2022.
