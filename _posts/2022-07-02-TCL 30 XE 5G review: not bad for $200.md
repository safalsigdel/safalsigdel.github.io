The TCL 30 XE has a bad screen, skimpy storage, lackluster camera, and runs a version of Android that's nearly two years behind everyone else. It's basically a slightly cheaper, slightly worse version of the Samsung Galaxy A13 5G that only works on T-Mobile. But it's $200, and at that price, it's about the best phone you can get.
