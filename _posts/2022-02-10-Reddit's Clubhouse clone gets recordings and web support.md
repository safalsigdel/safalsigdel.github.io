Reddit Talk, the platform's audio-only chatrooms, now support recordings. As outlined in a post on Reddit's blog, this means you can now listen to previous talks as well as use playback tools that let you jump to certain timestamps, pause / unpause recordings, and fast-forward or rewind them. This should make it even easier for users to record and distribute live podcast-like sessions.
