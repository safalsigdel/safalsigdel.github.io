Capcom has launched a demo of Resident Evil Village that's powered by Google's Stadia cloud gaming tech, letting people test out the horror game in a browser. In a press release, Google says that the idea is to let people try out the game, no matter what device they own. The game and its demo were already available for Stadia subscribers, but now anyone can try it out for free, provided they have a supported web browser and an internet connection faster than 10 megabits a second. You don't even need a Google account; you just navigate to the website, enter your birthday (the game's rated M), and click the play button.
