Apple's newest developer betas for iPadOS and macOS Monterey include Universal Control, indicating the long-awaited feature might finally be released sometime in the near future. Universal Control, which Apple announced at WWDC 2021 in June, is an impressive-looking feature that lets you use a Mac's keyboard and mouse with an iPad just by placing the iPad next to the computer. Universal Control seems to have been more ambitious than Apple anticipated, however, since it already missed a fall release estimate, is now supposed to come out this spring, and hadn't even shown up in betas until Thursday.
