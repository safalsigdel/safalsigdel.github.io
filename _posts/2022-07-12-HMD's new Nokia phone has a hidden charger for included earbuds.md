HMD has announced a trio of new Nokia feature phones including the Nokia 5710 XpressAudio, which has a built-in charging case for an included pair of true wireless earbuds. The company is far from the first to have had this idea (check out 2019's Servo R25 as one recent example), but it's notable to see the form factor attempted by a more established company with global reach.
