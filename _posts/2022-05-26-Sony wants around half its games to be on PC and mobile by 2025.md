Sony plans for roughly half of its game releases to be on PC or mobile by 2025, according to a presentation given during the company's annual investor day. A chart shown during the presentation suggests this would be a major increase from its releases this year, when around a quarter of the company's releases will be on PC and mobile, with the remainder split between its PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles.
