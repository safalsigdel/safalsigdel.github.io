The OnePlus 10T isn't due to launch until August 3rd, but it wouldn't be a OnePlus phone if the company didn't reveal a few details early. Today, we're getting a look at the device's exterior design, which reveals a couple of interesting (and, depending on your viewpoint, potentially disappointing) changes compared to its predecessor. Although the 10T's overall design is similar to that of the OnePlus 10 Pro, there's no alert / mute slider this time, nor is there any sign of the Hasselblad branded-camera system found on recent OnePlus flagships.
