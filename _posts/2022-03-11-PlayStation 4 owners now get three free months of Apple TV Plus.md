Sony is once again announcing a cross-promotion with Apple TV Plus to offer its console owners an extended free trial of the premium service. Owners of the last-gen PlayStation 4 console that are not already Apple TV Plus subscribers can redeem three months of service at no charge. After that, it's back to the usual $4.99 per month. This promo is similar to the one announced last summer, where PlayStation 5 owners got six months of Apple TV Plus. Both promos are redeemable until July 22nd, 2022.
