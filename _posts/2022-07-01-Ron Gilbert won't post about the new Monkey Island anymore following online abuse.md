This week, we finally saw the first gameplay trailer of Return to Monkey Island, a follow-up to the first and second Monkey Island games that's headed up by Ron Gilbert. Much of the game's rollout has been delightful — an apparent April Fools' joke by Gilbert about a new Monkey Island game turned out to be a real announcement. But there's been some sour discourse following the new trailer, and on his personal blog, Gilbert said he won't be posting about Return to Monkey Island anymore (via Eurogamer).
