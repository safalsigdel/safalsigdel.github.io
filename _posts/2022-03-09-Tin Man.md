Almost all of the photographs on Joseph Wyman Brown's website are of faces, people staring directly out of the frame in a way that is at once striking and slightly unsettling. He makes his photos using wet plate tintype, a process that hasn't been widely used for nearly a century, and which produces contrast and detail not found in today's digital photography â€” at least not without significant retouching. The photographer's involvement in the artistic process of tintype is obvious: look closely around the ragged edges of each image and you can literally see his fingerprints etched into the emulsion.
