Nothing has pushed my PC further than Microsoft Flight Simulator. That might sound odd for a “game” that's largely about flying around empty skies by yourself, but Asobo's latest iteration of the classic franchise is technically groundbreaking and ambitious, with all manner of wizardry going on beyond the scenes to stream in accurate city data, real-time weather effects, and so on. I've still had a great time with it, but compared to most AAA games, Flight Simulator asks a lot more of your CPU.
