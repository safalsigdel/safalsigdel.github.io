Instagram is kicking off a week of product reveals with the announcement of “Collabs,” a new feature that lets two users jointly share ownership of a single feed post or Reel. Tomorrow, it's following this up by testing a new way to add a nonprofit fundraiser to a post, and finally on Thursday it's rolling out the ability to create photo and video posts on desktop, as well as launching new music-focused effects for Reels.
