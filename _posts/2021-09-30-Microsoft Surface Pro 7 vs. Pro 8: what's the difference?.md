During its recent Surface event, Microsoft launched the largest upgrade of its flagship Intel-powered Surface Pro lineup in years: the Surface Pro 8. The new 2-in-1 machine boasts a 120Hz display, Thunderbolt 4 support, and new processors, but all of those improvements come at a cost â€” literally. Whereas the Surface Pro 7 starts at $549.99, the Surface Pro 8 starts at $1,099.99, meaning it's nearly double the price. And that's also before you factor in the cost of Microsoft's new stylus and detachable keyboard, two add-ons that are more like necessities if you intend to use the 2-in-1 as advertised.
