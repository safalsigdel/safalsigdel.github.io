Gaming phones are out of good ideas. Each one that I've tried is a slightly different take on an exorbitant design, of course. But it's just a couple of companies making powerful yet very similar (and, apparently, sometimes very fragile) phones that aren't really worth the effort of tracking down â€” even for the most die-hard of mobile gamers. Yet so far Xiaomi's Black Shark gaming brand may be the first that has resorted to titillation to stand out.
