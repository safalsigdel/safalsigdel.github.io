Ring Fit Adventure, the box set for the Nintendo Switch that includes the fitness adventure game along with a pilates ring that a Joy-Con slides into, is selling for just $54.99 at Best Buy and Amazon, matching the best price we've seen. It's normally $85. Actually, it's been selling for this price since Black Friday, but if your New Year's resolutions include getting in shape, this game is a fun, effective way to stay moving.
