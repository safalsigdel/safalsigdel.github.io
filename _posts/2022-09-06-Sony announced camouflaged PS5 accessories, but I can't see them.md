Next up on Sony's list of colorways to coat its PS5 accessories is gray camouflage. The company released a YouTube video allegedly showing off a DualSense, Pulse 3D headset, and console covers, all clad in camouflage. I say “allegedly” because I'm taking Sony's word for it. I can't see the accessories, so the camo must be working.
