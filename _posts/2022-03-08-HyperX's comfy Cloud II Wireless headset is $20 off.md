HyperX's best gaming gadgets don't see discounts all that often, but there are some sizeable price cuts happening today at Amazon. Of the bunch, HyperX's Cloud II Wireless is the one that I can easily recommend for people looking for a great wireless gaming headset that's compatible with PC, PlayStation consoles, as well as the Nintendo Switch dock. You can get $20 off this model, which now costs $129.99.
