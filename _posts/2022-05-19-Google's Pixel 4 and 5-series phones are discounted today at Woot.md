There's been a lot of talk about new Pixel phones lately, with last week's Google I/O showing off not just a new Pixel 6A but a brief glimpse of the upcoming Pixel 7 and 7 Pro. But Woot is showing love for some slightly older Pixels with a sale event that'll end later today. Somehow, Woot got its hands on phones that are all still new in the box with full one-year warranties.
