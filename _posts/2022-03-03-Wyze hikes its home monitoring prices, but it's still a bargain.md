If you were thinking of picking up Wyze's super cheap home security system, you might want to do it now. Starting April 6th, Wyze is increasing the price of its 24/7 professional home monitoring service for the system from $4.99 a month to $9.99 a month. Existing subscribers will stay locked into their current price, however. “This price increase will help us cover rising costs, make the service more sustainable, and allow us to continue adding new features,” the company said in an email sent to subscribers announcing the change.
