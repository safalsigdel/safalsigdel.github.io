The Matrix: Resurrections is still a ways off with a premier date of December 22nd, 2021, but you can watch two (and maybe more) teasers for the highly anticipated film today, in advance of a full trailer on Thursday. The teasers appear on the recently revived “What is The Matrix” website, gated by the film franchise's all too familiar choice — red pill or blue pill?
