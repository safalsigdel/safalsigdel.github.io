Having trouble connecting to a big game of Halo Infinite multiplayer with a bunch of your friends in the game's 12-person-per-side Big Team Battle mode? That will hopefully soon be a thing of the past: developer 343 says it's not only aware, it believes it has “a fix in hand for the core issue” and will release a special hotfix specifically for it. “It's a little too soon to give an ETA yet but please know our goal is to release this as soon as we can,” write the developers in an official blog post,” adding that “It won't be this week, but we hope it's not too much further out and we'll share an update as soon as we have line of sight on a release date (once we clear ‘cert' we are then ready to ship).”
