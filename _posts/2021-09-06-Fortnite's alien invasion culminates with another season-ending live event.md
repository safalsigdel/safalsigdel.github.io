Ever since Fortnite's current season debuted in June, there has been the promise of a massive conflict with a group of aliens. Now developer Epic is finally teasing that big event in the form of “Operation: Sky Fire.” The live event will be taking place on September 12th at 4PM ET, and Epic says that players will “join a strike team and sneak aboard the Mothership to deliver IO's final message to the invading aliens.” It will also be a one-time only thing: if you miss it, you'll have to catch up on YouTube. As always, Epic is recommending players log in early to get a spot.
