When you start using TikTok, you're asked for a profile name and a username. If you've been using TikTok for a while, though, it wouldn't be unusual to decide that you want to change one or both. Perhaps you used your real name and weren't aware at first that your name would be made public. Or perhaps the name you originally chose is no longer quite right for the type of content you're going to post. Or perhaps you simply decided that you want to be known by something more exciting.
