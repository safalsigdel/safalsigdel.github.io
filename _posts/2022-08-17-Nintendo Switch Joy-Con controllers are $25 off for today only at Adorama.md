While Nintendo's Joy-Cons may be the bane of some people's existence due to their small size and notorious reputation for developing stick drift, they remain the de facto controller for the Nintendo Switch. They also remain a bit expensive, normally costing $79.99 for a pair of them. Yes, you get more value out of them since you can split them up and use them individually for two-player games, but it's usually at the cost of comfort and limited game compatibility. Thankfully, today, you can pick up a set of the classic neon red and neon blue Joy-Cons for a steeply discounted price of $54.99 at Adorama.
