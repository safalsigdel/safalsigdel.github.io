Robinhood's cryptocurrency wallet, which lets users spend and trade select digital currencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum, is being made available to “all eligible customers'' on its waitlist, the company has announced. That amounts to over two million people, although the company cautions that the wallet won't be available in Hawaii, Nevada, or New York due to “local regulations.” The wallet was initially launched as a limited test last year.
