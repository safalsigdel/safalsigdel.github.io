There's something strangely satisfying about leaving a trail of colorful flowers in your wake as you explore a neighborhood. It's also one of the main hooks of Pikmin Bloom, the next release from the creator of Pokxc3xa9mon Go, and another app designed to get you moving in the real world. I've been able to play the game for the past few days, and while it's less of a game than Pokxc3xa9mon Go, it definitely adds some magic and fun to a daily walk.
