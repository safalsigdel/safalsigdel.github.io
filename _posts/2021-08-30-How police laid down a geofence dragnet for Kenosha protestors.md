On August 23rd, 2020, police shot Jacob Blake four times at a traffic stop in Kenosha, Wisconsin â€” and within hours, the streets were full of protestors. The National Guard was activated the following morning, and the next week would see as many as 40 buildings destroyed, as well as two people shot dead by a counter-protestor before order was restored.
