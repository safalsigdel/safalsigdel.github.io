If you're a member of GameStop's PowerUp Pro Rewards program, you can grab an Xbox Series X bundle if you head down to your local Gamestop. This exclusively in-store event begins when their doors open, and while some GameStop stores don't open until 11 AM local time, some can open as early as 9 AM, so check the hours of your local participating GameStop to plan accordingly.
