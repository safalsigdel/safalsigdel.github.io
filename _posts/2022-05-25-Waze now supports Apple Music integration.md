Waze has finally introduced support for Apple Music on iPhones, allowing you to control your music through the navigation app's built-in audio player. This should make it easier for you to pause, play, and switch between songs while following the directions to your destination. You'll also get access to Apple Music's wide selection of playlists directly through Waze, which means you shouldn't have to open the Apple Music app at all.
