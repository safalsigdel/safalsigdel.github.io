Alienware has announced a release date and pricing info for its latest batch of gaming laptops. Today's big news is that the new Dell G15, the Alienware M15 R7, and the Alienware M17 R5 are available now. Notably, each of the configurations will come equipped with AMD's 6000-series processors (paired with Nvidia's RTX 30-series graphics cards by default) and fast DDR5 RAM, among other impressive specs. Intel-based versions will likely release later in 2022.
