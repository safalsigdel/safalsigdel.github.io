The Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II, often referred to in shorthand as the QC35 II, are just about the cheapest they've ever sold for today. Woot has new, black-colored units with a one-year Bose warranty for $195. According to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel, this is $5 cheaper than the previous best price on record. These aren't the latest noise-canceling headphones to hit the market. They released in late 2017, and the reasons they're still popular are because of their solid sound quality, comfort, a dedicated voice assistant button, and an effective noise cancellation effect. One thing you might not like about them, though, is that they recharge via a Micro USB port.
