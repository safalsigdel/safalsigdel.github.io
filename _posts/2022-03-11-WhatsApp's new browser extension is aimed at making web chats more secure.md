Code Verify is a new browser extension from WhatsApp parent company Meta that aims to improve the security of WhatsApp's web version, the company has announced. The extension works by verifying that the contents of WhatsApp's web version haven't been tampered with. The aim is to make it a lot more difficult for a would-be attacker to compromise data or the privacy of WhatsApp's end-to-end encrypted messages when using the browser-based version of the service.
