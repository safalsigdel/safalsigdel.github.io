Nintendo has promised to fix an annoying bug that's cropped up in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, a Nintendo 64 game that's available via Nintendo's Online Expansion Pack subscription. According to NintendoLife, the bug makes it so players can't move if they're hit by certain enemies or items in the game's underwater levels. The only way to fix it, according to people who say they've experienced the bug, is to exit the level.
