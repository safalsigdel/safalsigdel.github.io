Hello! I'm back from Thanksgiving break and now have mashed potatoes for brains. Really, I've eaten mashed potatoes five days in a row. I can stop, but I won't stop until the leftovers are gone. Anyway, in between mashed potato servings, I did my best to “log off” and not think about audio — no offense — so instead, I binged the entire new season of Selling Sunset and played many crosswords. I'm back for you now, though, and we have a big issue ahead. We're talking about how a dating app stumbled upon viral audio success, and I chatted with the CEO of podcasting's latest $100 million-funded company, Podimo. Plus, an update to my RadioPublic story from last week and new Apple charts. Lots! Of! Stuff(ing)! On we go.
