Facebook is planning a high-end virtual and augmented reality headset codenamed “Project Cambria.” The device, which was teased briefly during Facebook's Connect keynote, features cameras that pass high-resolution full-color video to the headset's screens. It's supposed to include cutting-edge features that Facebook can't yet include in the Oculus Quest lineup, but there's no price or exact release date yet — although Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says it's a “completely new” product that will sit at the “high end of the price spectrum,” and we'll apparently see the device released next year.
