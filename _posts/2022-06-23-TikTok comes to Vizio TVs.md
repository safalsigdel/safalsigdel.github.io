Vizio has become the latest smart TV manufacturer to get a TikTok app, allowing owners to watch the short-form focused video platform on the big screen. It's just the latest manufacturer to add TikTok to its TV platform, after the app came to Samsung and LG's TVs, Android TV, and Amazon's Fire TV platforms last year. Vizio says you'll be able to browse TikTok's Discover feed, or link an account to watch video content from the For You and Following feeds.
