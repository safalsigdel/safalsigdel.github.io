Samsung is reportedly scaling back the number of phones it's planning on producing in 2022, from 310 million to 280 million, according to SamMobile, which cites a report from Korean outlet Maeil Business News. In absolute terms, that's still quite a lot of phones, but it's a relatively sharp decrease from the company's original goal (and from the reported number of phones it and its partners produced last year). It seems that there may be a trend of manufacturers preparing for the economy to get worse before it gets better.
