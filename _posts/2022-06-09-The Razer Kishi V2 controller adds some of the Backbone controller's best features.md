Razer has announced the $99.99 Kishi V2, its new mobile controller that can cradle your Android phone to deliver a more handheld console-like experience. In terms of what's new over the previous iteration, the Kishi V2 features some hardware traits in common with Razer's Wolverine V2 controller. Namely, that its buttons utilize microswitches instead of membranes, so they'll have a clicky feel. Also, there are two macro buttons near the triggers, one on each side, that can be custom programmed with a mobile app.
