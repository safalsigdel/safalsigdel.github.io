Twitter's redesigned process for reporting policy violations on its platform is now widely available, the company has announced. It's designed to handle everything from reports about misinformation and spam, to harassment and hate speech. The redesign has been in testing since December last year, and uses a so-called “symptoms-first reporting flow” that's designed to make it easier to report bad behavior. It's now available in “most countries” across web, iOS, and Android.
