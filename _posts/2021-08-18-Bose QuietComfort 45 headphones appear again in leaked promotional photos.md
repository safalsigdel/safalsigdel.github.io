After first surfacing last month in an FCC filing (which Bose quickly withdrew), the company's upcoming QuietComfort 45 headphones have now been leaked more extensively courtesy of WinFuture. Set to be priced at $329, the QC45s certainly look the part of a successor to the popular QC35s. The overall design is very similar, with some modern refinements like a USB-C port thrown in.
