Samsung is adding a new and extremely exploitable customization option to its line of Bespoke refrigerators. Sling the company $500 and you can have any photo or image you like printed on the unit's double doors. You could choose a favorite piece of artwork, a child's doodles, or just put your own face on your own fridge for no good reason at all.
