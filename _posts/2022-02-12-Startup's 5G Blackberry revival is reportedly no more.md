Plans to resurrect the Blackberry brand with a new keyboard-equipped 5G Android device have been shelved, according to reports from Android Police and CrackBerry. Development on the device was announced in 2020 by Texas-based startup OnwardMobility, after it licensed the brand name from Blackberry. The device was rumored to use a similar design to 2015's Blackberry Priv — which had a physical keyboard that could be revealed with a slide of its screen — with a release date planned for some time in 2021.
