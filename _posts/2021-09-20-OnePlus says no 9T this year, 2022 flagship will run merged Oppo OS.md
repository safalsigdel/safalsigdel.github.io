OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has confirmed that the company doesn't plan to release its traditional T-series device in the second half of this year. He also announced that next year's OnePlus flagship phone would run on a newly unified operating system, following the company's integration with fellow BBK Electronics subsidiary Oppo. OnePlus announced it would be merging the codebases of its Android-based OxygenOS operating system with Oppo's ColorOS in July.
