We've all done it: sent a text message and then instantly regretted it. Whether it was a text to your parent with a spelling error that they'd never let you live down, a message with a wrong word in it (“I don't want to come to the party!” instead of “I want to come to the party!”), or a sudden realization that you just sent your message to the wrong person — it can be embarrassing at the least and disastrous at the worst.
