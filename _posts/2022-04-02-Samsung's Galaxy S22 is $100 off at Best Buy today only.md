We're kicking off April Fools' Day with a deal that's dead serious. For today only, Best Buy is knocking $100 off the price of the unlocked Samsung Galaxy S22. The 128GB and 256GB models of the S22 are currently discounted to $699.99 and $749.99, respectively. Just note that this discount only applies to the standard model of the S22, not the S22 Plus or Ultra. You don't have to activate this phone when you purchase it either, just make sure to select “activate later” before adding it to your cart. This is the first discount we've seen on the latest model of Samsung's smartphone since its release, making this a prime opportunity to upgrade.
