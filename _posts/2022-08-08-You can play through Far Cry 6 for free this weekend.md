Welcome to the weekend. Whether you're working today, or you're off, we have a range of deals that you might be interested in. Most of these were big hits throughout the week that we're resurfacing for your perusal, though we've packed in a few deals that popped up more recently. In terms of what to look forward to on The Verge, this week will be Samsung's Unpacked event. That's all happening on Wednesday, August 10th, and based on rumors, we expect to see new foldable phones and other gadgets, and plenty of preorder deals. See you then.
