Windows 11 updates, which Microsoft sends to your system regularly, are meant to keep your operating system current. They are, for the most part, a good thing. But as long-time Windows users know, occasionally, an update can go wrong, and so some prefer to postpone updates for a week or two to make sure that there aren't any problems being delivered with the update. In addition, sometimes updates come at an inconvenient time — for example, when you're in the middle of a project with a tight deadline.
