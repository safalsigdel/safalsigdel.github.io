Gadgets with any attachment to Porsche Design tend to have a lousy track record, but its latest collaboration is tough to knock. It partnered with AOC (the accessory company, not the US representative) to Porsche-fy this high-end Agon Pro PD32M gaming monitor that's available for preorder now and shipping in June for $1,799. Beyond the frameless 32-inch panel, which has Mini LED backlighting for better contrast and light control, its minimalist, sturdy-looking aluminum stand mimics the style of Porsche steering wheels.
