After testing Samsung smartwatches, I'm usually left with a furrowed brow, wondering what could have been. It's not because they're bad, ugly, or a pain to wear. Actually, it's the opposite. Hands down, Samsung's smartwatches are the best Android users can buy right now, and the $279.99 Galaxy Watch 5 is no exception. (Though that may change once the Google Pixel Watch arrives.) If Samsung would fix one — maybe two — things, its smartwatches would make the Apple Watch yesterday's news. I was hoping to report that Samsung had finally nailed it, but for better or worse, the Watch 5 is more of the same.
