The MacBook Pro remains Apple's top-end option for notebooks with speedy M1 processors. There are talks of new models with a rumored M1X update, but as of now, if you're looking for the best the M1 has to offer in the shape of a laptop, it's the late-2020 MacBook Pro. Today, the 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro is $150 off at Amazon and Best Buy, bringing it down to $1,150 with 256GB of storage or $1,350 for 512GB. This is the second-best price of all time on the popular laptop from Apple.
