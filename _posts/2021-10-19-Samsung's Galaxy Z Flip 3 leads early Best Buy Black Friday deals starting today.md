All the buzz of yesterday's Apple Mac event and today's Google Pixel launch might fall a little bit flat if you're a Samsung fan. While there is an Unpacked 2 event set for Wednesday, we're not expecting any major new announcements aside from some fun color customization options. In the meantime, a big highlight of today is Best Buy's deal on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, knocking $150 off an unlocked model of your choice.
