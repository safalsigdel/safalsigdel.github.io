BMW is temporarily shipping some new vehicles without support for Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, and Wi-Fi after changing chip suppliers, according to a report from Automotive News Europe (via 9to5Google). The chips from the new supplier need a software update to make Android Auto and CarPlay accessible through the Android / Apple interface.
