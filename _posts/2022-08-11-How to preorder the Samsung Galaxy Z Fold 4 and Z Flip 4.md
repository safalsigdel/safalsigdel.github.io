After its recent announcements at the August 10th Unpacked event, Samsung's latest generation of foldable phones are official, and they're coming out soon. The Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Z Flip 4 are promising many refinements to Samsung's established foldable formula. It remains a two-pronged approach: the cheaper Flip 4 folds in half from a “normal”-sized phone to a tiny device that's easily pocketable, while the ultra-flagship Fold 4 sits at the top end, expanding from an average-sized phone to a mini tablet. Both models are set to arrive on August 26th, and preorders are now open across retailers and carriers.
