Intel's had a hard time competing with AMD lately. AMD's Ryzen Zen 3 CPUs took the performance crown from Intel in gaming a year ago, and Intel's response with its 11th Gen Core i9-11900K earlier this year was lackluster, to say the least. While it bumped some game performance, overall, it wasn't enough to close the gap with AMD's Ryzen 9 5950X in both performance and power consumption. Some reviewers even labeled it “pathetic” and a “waste of sand.” Ouch.
