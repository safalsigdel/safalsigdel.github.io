You wouldn't want to fly most drones in a serious downpour, even most industrial-grade ones from DJI. Until today, DJI's state-of-the-art was the M300 RTK, a drone that took a barrage of water in marketing videos but where the fine print (PDF) says that snow and heavy rain are not OK for flying. But DJI's weather sealing and confidence rating have improved — the new DJI M30 Enterprise, announced today, is explicitly ready for “heavy rain, high winds, high altitudes, even in icy and snowy conditions from -20xc2xb0 C to 50xc2xb0 C,” according to the company.
