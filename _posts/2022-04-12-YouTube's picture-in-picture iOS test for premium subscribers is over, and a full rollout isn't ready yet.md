Despite a now-deleted tweet from YouTube's support account that seemingly indicated otherwise, YouTube Premium subscribers can no longer sign up to test YouTube's picture-in-picture feature on iOS. Picture-in-picture has disappeared from YouTube's list of available experimental features, where it was previously listed with an April 8th expiry date. 9to5Google reports that some users are seeing a “the feature you're trying has been turned off” banner notifying them that the test has ended. Both 9to5Google and iMore add that the feature is still working on accounts that previously signed up for the test.
