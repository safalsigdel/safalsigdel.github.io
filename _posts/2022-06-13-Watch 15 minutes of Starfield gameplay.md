After an early glimpse of Starfield at Microsoft's Xbox & Bethesda showcase last year and a delay to 2023, we're now getting a much closer look at Bethesda's first new IP in 25 years thanks to 15 minutes of gameplay. Starfield is, naturally, set in space where players will take on the role of a last group of explorers. Described as “Skyrim in space,” by game director Todd Howard, the RPG will be playable in both first- and third-person, but primarily it's first-person.
