One of the features Google offers exclusively through its Pixel Android phones is the Personal Safety app. Over the years, it's added features like a safety check-in that automatically notifies your emergency contacts if you don't respond as scheduled and the ability to automatically dial 911 if it detects you've been in a car accident. Now XDA-Developers and Android Police point out a new feature that can automatically record video if you activate the built-in Emergency SOS.
