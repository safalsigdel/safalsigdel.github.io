If you weren't able to take advantage of the great discount that we saw on the new Kindle Paperwhite during Black Friday 2021, you now have a second chance. The 2021 Kindle Paperwhite is one of the best e-readers on the market, and right now, it's also available at its best price ever. Typically selling for $139.99, you can buy the new Paperwhite in the ad-supported configuration at Amazon, GameStop, and Best Buy for $104.99. The ad-free version is also on sale at Amazon for $119.99 instead of $159.99.
