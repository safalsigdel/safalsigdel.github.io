Uber says that it's “completely reimagined the way drivers accept rides” with a feature called “upfront fares,” which shows drivers exactly how much they'll be paid for a trip and where they'll end up after dropping a rider off. In its announcement on Friday, the company says the change is part of its push to make driving for the rideshare service more flexible. Uber's also planning on rolling out a feature that lets drivers see other ride requests in their area, letting them pick specific trips they'd like to do.
