Want to add some fun colors to your gaming space? Right now, Govee is offering its first discount on its new DreamView G1 Pro gaming lights. The camera-powered, dynamic LED kit typically retails for $179.99, but Govee is selling it for $159.99 for a limited time. These lights can match the colors displayed on your monitor while gaming, which can help create a fun and immersive experience. They also come with four preset game-match modes that deliver various effects, like a racing mode that matches fast-moving colors by splitting up the light bar into smaller color segments and moving pulsing waves of colors up and down.
