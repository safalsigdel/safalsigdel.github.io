Kick off the weekend with a steep discount on the latest, fastest iteration of the Apple TV 4K. The 32GB model normally retails for $179.99 (it's usually one of the pricier streaming devices out there), but you can grab one for a much more reasonable $129.99. This deal debuted earlier this week, and we can't get enough of it. If you want to double the internal storage to 64GB, that model is just $20 more at $149.99 instead of $199.99.
