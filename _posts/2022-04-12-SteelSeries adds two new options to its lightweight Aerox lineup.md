SteelSeries has expanded its IP54 waterproof and lightweight Aerox Wireless lineup to include two new options available starting today: the Aerox 5 Wireless and the Aerox 9 Wireless. The Aerox 9 Wireless, pictured above, is SteelSeries' take on a mouse made for MMO and MOBA games that have myriad commands that you might need to fire off. It has a whopping 12 buttons on its left side, and SteelSeries claims that, at 89 grams, this is the lightest mouse of this type on the market.
