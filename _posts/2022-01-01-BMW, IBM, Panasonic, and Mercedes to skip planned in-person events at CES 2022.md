BMW has announced it will no longer be showing up in person for media events at CES 2022 — the giant electronics show that's typically held each January in Las Vegas, attracting well over 100,000 attendees per year from around the world. It's the latest company to at least partially bail on the show, following announcements from Intel, AMD, GM, Google, T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta, Waymo, and a large number of tech publications, including The Verge, as COVID cases rise in the US.
