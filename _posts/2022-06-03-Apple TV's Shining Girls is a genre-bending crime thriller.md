Over the past couple of months, Shining Girls has shown us, in rude and anxiety-ridden detail, exactly how life hasn't been kind to newspaper archivist Kirby Mazrachi (Elisabeth Moss). When we first meet her in 1992 Chicago, she says she chose her new name because it “sounded fun.” But I convince myself it's because Kirby's Dream Land came out that very same year. This is probably the last glib, carefree thought I have about Kirby for the rest of the series.
