The all-new Kindle Paperwhite is already an exceptional buy at its regular price of $140. It has a great 6.8-inch display, USB-C charging, and a battery that can last for months — our reviewer calls it “the ultimate Kindle.” If you've been eyeing this device, now is a great time to buy it. Ahead of Cyber Monday, it's available on Amazon right now for $105, which is $35 and 25 percent off its original price of $140. Other retailers, such as Staples, are offering the same price.
