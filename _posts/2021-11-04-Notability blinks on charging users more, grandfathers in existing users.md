Notability developer Ginger Labs announced today that, in a change of heart, its popular note-taking app wouldn't eventually require current users to switch to a subscription model. This news comes just two days after the developer announced a new subscription model where current app owners who wanted to keep the same features would be forced to start a $14.99 / year subscription by November 1st, 2022.
