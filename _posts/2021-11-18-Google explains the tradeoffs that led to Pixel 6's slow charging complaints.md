Google has responded to allegations that the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro don't charge as fast as some have expected, confirming that their charging speeds are a deliberate tradeoff for better battery life. It follows a report from Android Authority which found that the phones' maximum power draw was around 22W, well short of the 30W that Google's latest USB-C charging brick is technically capable of.
