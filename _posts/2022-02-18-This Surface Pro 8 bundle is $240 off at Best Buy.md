The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 is currently the lowest price we've seen in the past several months. Normally, this configuration of Microsoft's tablet with the Type Cover costs $1,239.98 but is currently $999.98 at Best Buy, an excellent value for both products. When The Verge writer Monica Chin reviewed this laptop for us, she had no shortage of good things to say about it. Between the 120Hz display and the refreshed aesthetic, this is a model we can definitely recommend.
