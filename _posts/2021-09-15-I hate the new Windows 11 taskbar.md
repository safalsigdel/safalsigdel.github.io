Microsoft promotes itself as the productivity company, but the new Windows 11 taskbar removes key functionality and makes me less productive as a result. Missing features include power user elements like displaying the time and date on multiple monitors, or simple things like having small icons and being able to move the taskbar around. There's so much missing here that I'm stunned Microsoft is shipping a new OS that takes the Windows taskbar back decades.
