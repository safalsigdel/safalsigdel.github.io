Instagram is asking some users to provide a video selfie showing multiple angles of their face to verify that they're a real person, according to screenshots posted to Twitter by social media consultant Matt Navarra. The social network has long struggled with bot accounts, which can leave spam messages, harass people, or be used to artificially inflate like or follower counts.
