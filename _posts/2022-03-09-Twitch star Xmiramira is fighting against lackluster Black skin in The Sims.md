Amira Virgil, known as Xmiramira on Twitch and YouTube, felt something wasn't right with The Sims 4. Virgil, a content creator and video game streamer, is also a storyteller. Her YouTube page is filled with playlists of soap-opera style Sims 4 Let's Plays in which she crafts narratives to accompany the actions of her characters in the game. She's like a showrunner, acting as producer, director, script writer, and, ultimately, God, controlling her characters as they move through a world she created using The Sims 4 and its elaborate library of expansion packs. But something just wasn't right about the characters she was creating. Something was off.
