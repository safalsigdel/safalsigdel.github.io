Another week, another chance to kick it off with some savings. Let's start with an exceptional value on some robot vacuums. Robovacs get very expensive very quickly, though there are some lower-cost options worth your time. Today, and today only, you can get the Yeedi k650 vacuum for just $113.99 on Amazon's deal of the day when you click the on-page coupon for an added $20 discount. This sale knocks $66 off the price of this robot vacuum that tackles pet hair and syncs with Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa to slot into your smart home life. It features an extra-large 800-milliliter dustbin, which is helpful because, in the end, you have to empty it yourself.
