Apple's new proposals for dating apps in the Netherlands haven't gone far enough to appease the country's competition regulator, which has just announced that it's fining the company another xe2x82xac5 million (around $5.6 million). It's the fourth weekly fine levied against the company, bringing the total to xe2x82xac20 million (around $22.6 million), and these fines are set to continue weekly while the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) thinks Apple is failing to comply with its order.
