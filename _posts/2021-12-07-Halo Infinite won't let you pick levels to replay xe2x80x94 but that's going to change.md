Halo Infinite's campaign launches on Wednesday, but after your first trip through the story, you won't be able to replay missions without starting all the way over, Microsoft confirmed to Polygon. It's a significant omission, since it means you won't be able to get collectibles you miss the first time around. It also means Infinite is the first Halo game without a way to go back and easily replay a chapter.
