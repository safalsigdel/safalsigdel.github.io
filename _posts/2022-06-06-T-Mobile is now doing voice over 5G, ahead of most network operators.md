According to the US carriers, 5G has well and truly arrived. We did it! We won the race to 5G. But there's one piece of the puzzle that's still largely missing: voice. Phone calls still mainly rely on LTE networks, even where 5G data coverage is robust. Today, T-Mobile announced that it has taken a small step forward in making voice over 5G a reality.
