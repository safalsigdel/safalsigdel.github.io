Our lead deal on the Bose QC35 II headphones from earlier has sold out, but there's another fantastic deal happening on the Surface Pro 7. Microsoft has discounted all models, and the configuration with 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD that usually costs $900 is now $700. That's a great price, but note that the Surface Pro 7 doesn't include a Type Cover bunded for free. You might be able to find one of those for $100 or less, but if you don't want to go hunting for one, Best Buy is offering this same configuration with a Type Cover included for $799 (usually $1,029, since the Type Cover retails for $129).
