Cadillac is offering one final teaser of the Cadillac Celestiq ahead of its full reveal later this week. The ultra-luxe EV will soon join the Lyriq and become the second full EV to ship out of GM's luxury division, although the Celestiq is expected to be in a class of its own with a price that could start around the $300,000 range with a 500-units-per-year production target.
