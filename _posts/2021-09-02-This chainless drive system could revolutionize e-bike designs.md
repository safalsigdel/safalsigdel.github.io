We don't often write about bicycle components, but it's not everyday that an innovation like the Schaeffler Free Drive is announced for pedal-assisted e-bikes. The so-called “bike-by-wire” system, first spotted by Electrek, dispenses with the need to string a chain or belt between the pedals and wheel hub. It's an all-electric drive system that allows for entirely new bicycle designs with fewer moving parts.
