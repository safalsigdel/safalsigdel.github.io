While Google confirmed last month that a Pixel Watch is on its way, there's still a lot we don't know about the device, like its hardware specs. The rumor mill has been buzzing, however, and the gist is the device will purportedly feature a 300mAh battery and Samsung's last-gen wearable processor. The latest report from 9to5 Google claims that the watch will get around 24 hours of battery life on a single charge and that fast charging isn't in the mix. It might be tempting to cry doom and gloom, but if this pans out? These numbers are par for the course.
