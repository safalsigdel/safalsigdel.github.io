Now that Cyberpunk 2077 is in a somewhat more stable position, developer CD Projekt Red is talking more about the future — including the game's first expansion. Today, the studio revealed that the previously announced expansion for the game will be launching in 2023. Unfortunately, that's all we know; there's no information on what to expect from the first major content update for the game. CD Projekt Red says to expect more details “later this year.”
