HBO Max has started running an enticing deal where you can pay half price for the ad-free subscription tier, bringing it to just $7.49 per month. That rate, which is even lower than the ad-sponsored plan, will be good for up to six months, after which you'll be switched back to the standard $14.99. You've got to act relatively quickly to take advantage of the offer: it's available through September 26th.
