Sony's LinkBuds S are the company's latest earbuds, fitting into a lineup that consists of the flagship WF-1000XM4s, the very unique LinkBuds, and the entry-level WF-C500s. Though they share a name with the open-air LinkBuds, the “S” model earbuds have a far more conventional design that seals in the ear with silicone tips. This makes it possible for them to include active noise cancellation, which the regular LinkBuds lack, and Sony also added support for its higher-quality LDAC Bluetooth codec.
