Apple has indefinitely delayed the date which corporate employees will have to return to the office, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and NBC News' Zoe Schiffer. CEO Tim Cook sent an email to staff on Wednesday saying the return-to-work date is “yet to be determined.” He also announced that Apple would be giving all employees $1,000 that can be used for “work-from-home needs,” according to Gurman. Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy confirmed the $1,000 bonus to The Verge and says it will apply to every employee, including retail workers.
