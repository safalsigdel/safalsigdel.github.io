Google Fi is cutting the prices across its two unlimited cellular plans, in addition to adding more high-speed data (via 9to5Google). The Simply Unlimited plan has dropped from $60 / month to $50 / month for one line, while the full-featured Unlimited Plus plan now sits at $65 / month for one line, compared to its previous $70 / month price. This marks the first price cut for the Unlimited Plus and Simply Unlimited plans since their debuts in 2019 and 2021, respectively.
