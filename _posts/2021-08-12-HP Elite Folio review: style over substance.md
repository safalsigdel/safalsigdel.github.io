HP has put out what I can best describe as a Surface Pro X with a Spectre Folio form factor. The Elite Folio is a lightweight, leather-covered, convertible Windows laptop powered by a Snapdragon processor with Arm architecture. It's a neat-looking, futuristic system that's meant to be used on the go, rather than for intensive tasks.
