The long-awaited second part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake could be revealed on June 16th, or at least I hope it will. Square Enix's Twitter account for promoting that game sent out a Save the Date PSA for June 16th at 6PM ET / 3PM PT, when it'll go live on Twitch and YouTube with a brief 10-minute presentation. It appended “please be excited” to the end, which, I'll admit, made me excited.
