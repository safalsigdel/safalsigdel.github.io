Sony's Xperia 1 III has a few things that other flagship phones don't, including a near-4K, 120Hz OLED display, along with plenty of high-quality manual photo and video controls, dual front-facing speakers, and a headphone jack. And yet, The Verge's Allison Johnson couldn't recommend it â€” mostly due to its high $1,300 cost. Though, today's deal on the phone makes the price just a little more digestible. For only the second time since it launched during the summer, Sony's unlocked Xperia 1 III smartphone has returned to its all-time low price of $1,198 at Amazon and Adorama.
