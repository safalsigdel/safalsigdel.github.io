If you have a solid internet connection, you owe it to yourself to get a mesh Wi-Fi system. It'll help to cover more of your apartment or home in fast Wi-Fi. You can get Google's Wifi in a three-pack for $150 at Amazon, down from $200. This 25 percent discount is the biggest price markdown yet. And considering that Google sells a single Wifi unit for $100, it doesn't make much sense to opt for that when you can get another two for just $50 more.
