If you're a Pokxc3xa9mon fan, loading up on some of the more recent titles for the Nintendo Switch doesn't have to cost a fortune. Sadly, Pokxc3xa9mon Legends Arceus isn't looped into this $20 off deal (although it is $10 off at Amazon), but these other games should help you get your gotta-catch-em-all fix for less. Best Buy and Amazon are each discounting Pokxc3xa9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl (the remakes of Diamond and Pearl, originally released for the Nintendo DS in 2006) for $39.99 each.
