Porsche is strengthening its ties with Rimac, an electric supercar company, by participating in a $500 million investment round for the Croatia-based startup. Porsche didn't disclose the exact amount it invested in Rimac, except to say it was “eight figures.” And Porsche won't have a controlling interest in Rimac, retaining its previously disclosed 20 percent equity stake in the company.
