Today is officially Valentine's Day in the US, a day meant for expressing love and celebrating romance â€” or just eating a bunch of candy and chocolate. If you're a sentimental procrastinator and in need of a last-minute gift, we have some great suggestions for you in our Valentine's Day gift guide. We've also rounded up a wealth of last-minute ideas, which includes digital options and many gifts that are still available for in-store pickup. After all, at this point, anything is better than a bouquet from the gas station down the street.
