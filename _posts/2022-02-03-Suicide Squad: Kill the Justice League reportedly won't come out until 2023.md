The release of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is being delayed until next year, according to a report from Bloomberg. The game, which is being made by Rocksteady (the studio behind Batman: Arkham Asylum, City, and Knight), was scheduled to come out sometime in 2022. The game's Twitter account still lists the release date as 2022 in its bio, but as Bloomberg points out, a tweet from WarnerMedia's CEO about the company's 2022 game lineup didn't include Kill the Justice League.
