Netflix's “global fan event” is returning for a second-straight year. The streaming service announced that Tudum — not to be confused with Netflix's troubled fan site of the same name — will be streaming on YouTube on September 24th. There aren't many details yet, but Netflix says the event will cover more than 100 movies and series. And the day will be divided by region: things will kick off with news from Korea, followed by India, the US, Europe, and Latin America, before closing out with Japan.
