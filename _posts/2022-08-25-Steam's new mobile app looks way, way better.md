I've been using the Steam iOS app quite a bit since getting a Steam Deck, but every time I opened the app, I had to deal with an interface that just felt old â€” the overall design hadn't been updated in a very long time. It seems Valve felt that way, too, because it's now beta testing a new version of the app that looks dramatically different and, if you ask me, dramatically better.
