OnePlus is officially announcing a trio of more affordable devices for Europe today: the OnePlus Nord 2T, the Nord CE 2 Lite, and the Nord Buds true wireless headphones. The Nord 2T starts at xc2xa3369 (xe2x82xac399) and is best thought of as a souped-up version of last year's Nord 2. Meanwhile, the Nord CE 2 Lite is a step-down model of the Nord CE 2 and starts at xc2xa3279 (xe2x82xac299). Finally, there's the Nord Buds, which will sell for xc2xa349 (xe2x82xac49). The latter two launched in India last month but will be on sale in the UK on May 24th.
