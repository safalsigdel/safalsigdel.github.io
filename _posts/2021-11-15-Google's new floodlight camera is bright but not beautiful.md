If you're going to install one outdoor security camera at your home, a floodlight camera is the best option. You get lights and a camera in one unit to capture all the action and you don't have to mess with charging batteries or drilling holes through your walls for power cables â€” a floodlight cam can go wherever you have existing outdoor lighting. It's a win-win smart home device. The only downsides are a high upfront price and a more involved installation.
