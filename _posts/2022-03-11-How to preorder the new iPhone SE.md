At its “Peek Performance” hardware event, Apple announced the third-generation iPhone SE. It's similar in many ways to the 2020 version, with a 4.7-inch screen that's surrounded on top and bottom by thick bezels. Notably, it's still the only iPhone that Apple sells with Touch ID biometrics. But it has received three big enhancements since the last-gen phone, and you can probably guess one of them from the name: 5G, claims of better battery life than the previous SE, and Apple's modern A15 Bionic processor that's in the iPhone 13.
