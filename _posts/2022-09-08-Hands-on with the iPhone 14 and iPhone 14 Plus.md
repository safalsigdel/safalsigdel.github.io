The iPhone 14 is here, and it's available in two sizes this year: regular and big. The standard iPhone 14 sticks with the 6.1-inch display — notch intact — and the 14 Plus brings a big 6.7-inch screen to the standard, non-pro iPhone series for the first time. That's the story: aside from the new size, not much else has physically changed from the iPhone 13.
