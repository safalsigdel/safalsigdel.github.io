Sabrent has released a new Thunderbolt 3 dock, which includes up to 16TB of storage alongside a more typical array of dock ports. That storage doesn't come cheap, however. Although the 2TB version of the docking station is listed for $499.99 on Sabrent's site, opting for the full 16TB of storage sets you back an eye-watering $2,900.
