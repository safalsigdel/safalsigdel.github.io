Apple's latest MacBook Pro laptops have been a triumph of performance thanks to the beefy M1 Pro and M1 Max processors, as well as a redesign that saw the welcome return of dedicated ports for HDMI and SD cards. They're also on the pricey side, starting at $1,999.99 and going way up from there. Now, the faster 14-inch MacBook Pro with 10-core M1 Pro CPU and 1TB of storage has dropped to a new low price of $2,249.99 at Amazon â€” reflected as an automatic discount when it is added to your cart.
