Microsoft is readying a Surface Duo 2 for release later this year. Leaked images have revealed the dual-screen device will include a new triple camera system. The leaked images first appeared in a YouTube video last month, and Windows Central claims they're legitimate. Microsoft is expected to launch its Surface Duo 2 device in September or October.
