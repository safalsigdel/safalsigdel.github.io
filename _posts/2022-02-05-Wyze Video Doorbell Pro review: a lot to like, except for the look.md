The newest doorbell from Wyze surprised me in three ways: It isn't the cheapest video doorbell you can buy (odd from a company that's become a by-word for good budget smart home gear). It has excellent video quality for an under-$100 doorbell camera, and it has one of the most obnoxious designs of any doorbell, ever.
