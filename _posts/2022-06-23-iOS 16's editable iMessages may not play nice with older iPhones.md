The ability to edit and unsend messages was one of the flagship features of iOS 16 announced earlier this month, but the functionality may not work well if you're messaging anyone who's not using the latest version of Apple's software.

It could prove annoying for anyone in an iMessage group chat using an older iPhone or Android.
