Augmented reality company Nreal is launching a cheaper, iOS-compatible, more compact version of its smart glasses. The new Nreal Air glasses are supposed to ship starting in December 2021 across Japan, China, and South Korea. The price isn't set, but Nreal says they'll cost “a fraction of the price” of its earlier Nreal Light glasses, which started selling for around $600 last year.
