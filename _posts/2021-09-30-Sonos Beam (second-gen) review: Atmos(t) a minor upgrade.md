From the moment Sonos announced the second-generation Beam soundbar, it was evident that this sequel is more refresh than reinvention. The new Beam, available October 5th and now slightly more expensive at $449, is the same compact size as the 2018 original. The speaker drivers inside the unit are completely unchanged. Sonos has touched up the appearance by switching from a fabric covering on the first Beam to the company's signature perforated plastic with finely drilled holes running along the entire front of the soundbar. And because it's equipped with more processing power and eARC, the new model supports immersive Dolby Atmos audio.
