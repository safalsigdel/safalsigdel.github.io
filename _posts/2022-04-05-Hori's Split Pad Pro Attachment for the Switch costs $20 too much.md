You might already know about Hori's $59.99 Split Pad Pro, which reimagines the Nintendo Switch's Joy-Con controllers as if they got jacked in the gym. Hori launched the controller a couple of years ago alongside Daemon X Machina. It's made for people with big hands, or rather, anyone whose hands feel cramped using the Switch's included controls. Like Joy-Cons, the Split Pad Pro slides into the sides of your Switch, but it's about twice as wide, thicker, and has ergonomic grips and contours. Every button, trigger, and stick is larger and, thus, easier to control. With those changes, the Switch feels like an entirely different (and better) console to play on the go.
