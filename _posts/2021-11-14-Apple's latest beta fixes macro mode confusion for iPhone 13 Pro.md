Apple's latest iOS 15.2 beta is making the iPhone 13 Pro's macro mode simple by adding a button to let you turn it on and off (via 9to5Mac). The icon, which looks like a little flower, pops up whenever you're close enough to an object to take a macro photo and lets you easily switch between having Auto Macro mode on and off without having to go into settings.
