The MacBook Air with M1 processor, our top pick for the best laptop of 2021, is currently $200 off at Best Buy. This brings the popular laptop from Apple down to its historical low price of $799.99. We have often seen this MacBook Air discounted by $50, $100, and even occasionally $150, but this level of sale is much less frequent, and as good as it gets. Best Buy's deal on the MacBook Air is only running for today — scheduled to expire when it strikes midnight on December 14th — or while supplies last.
