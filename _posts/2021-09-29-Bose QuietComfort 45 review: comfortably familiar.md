Bose's Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, released in 2019, are a perfectly fine pair of premium noise-canceling headphones. They're Bose's attempt to leapfrog Sony and other competitors with a revamped, sleek design and more powerful active noise cancellation. But for some of the company's most loyal fans, they veer off a little too far from what they expect Bose headphones to be. The NCH 700s don't have the same feather-light comfort as the QuietComfort lineup, they annoyingly can't be folded for easy carrying, and generally, it seems like Bose needlessly tried to fix something that wasn't broken.
