Sony's 27-inch InZone M9 gaming monitor is practically a high-end 4K Bravia TV with a few features (and more than a few inches) chopped off. It can't serve your channels or streaming apps, but this monitor can deliver full array local dimming for more accurate backlighting, which is something few TVs and even fewer monitors can do. It's a great monitor if you watch a lot of HDR content on your computer â€” the matte panel looks bright, detailed, and gorgeous. It's like watching a really good TV that's not actually a TV.
