Nvidia's elusive RTX 30-series graphics cards are almost never in stock (for their MSRP cost, at least), but they'll be available to purchase fair-and-square tomorrow, Tuesday, July 20th, at some Best Buy locations around the US (per Polygon). Employees at these locations will begin giving out tickets to a select amount of people waiting in line at 7:30AM local time Tuesday morning, and getting one of these tickets will guarantee you the opportunity to purchase a GPU when each store opens up at 8:00AM local time.
