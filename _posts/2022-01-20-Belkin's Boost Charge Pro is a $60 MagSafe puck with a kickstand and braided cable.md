Belkin's new Boost Charge Pro wireless charging pad takes Apple's MagSafe puck and ... well, makes it “pro” with a 2-meter-long braided cable and a kickstand for propping your phone up to make it easier to see while it's charging (via MacRumors). It also comes in black, a must for any accessory sporting the pro moniker. There is a bit of a catch, though — like many accessories with official MagSafe certification, it doesn't come cheap.
