The Galaxy A13 5G doesn't offer much in the way of surprises, good or bad. For $249, it's a reliable device with good performance, healthy battery life, and a decent camera. None of this comes as a surprise because Samsung makes a lot of these kinds of phones, and it's something the company is very good at.
