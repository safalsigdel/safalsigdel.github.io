Tinder is expanding the ways you can judge a potential match by their musical tastes by introducing a Music Mode, which lets you actually hear the song someone's set as their “Anthem” before you choose which direction to swipe. Music Mode will integrate with Spotify, like Tinder's other music features, but should make it easier to judge someone by the song they've picked to represent themselves — even if you've never heard it before, you'll immediately be able to tell the vibe.
