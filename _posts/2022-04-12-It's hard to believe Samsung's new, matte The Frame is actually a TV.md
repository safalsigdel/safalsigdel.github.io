Not everyone cares about having the absolute best TV specs or pristine picture quality. It turns out there are a lot of people who hate having a traditional TV — this ugly black rectangle — disrupting the vibe and decor of their living room. Those are the same people who have turned Samsung's The Frame TV into such a big hit. I've got family members and co-workers who've all bought The Frame in the last year because of how well it disguises itself as a piece of art when not being used. You can customize the TV's bezels and swap between different options to get exactly the look you want when it's on your wall.
