A smart home without sensors and automations is basically a remote-controlled home. Using your voice or an app to turn lights on isn't much easier (and in some cases is harder) than flicking on a light switch. Smart is when lights just turn on as you walk into a room. But when you walk in and they don't turn on, that's worse. This common smart home frustration is something the Eve Motion Sensor ($39.99), with its shiny new Thread protocol on board, promises to fix.
