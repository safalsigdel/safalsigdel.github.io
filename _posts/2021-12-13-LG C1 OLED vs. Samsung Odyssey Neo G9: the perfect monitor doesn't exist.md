I hate leaving unfinished business, but that's what I did on November 27th of last year. I ended my review of the most ridiculous, most advanced PC monitor ever made — the 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9 — by wondering out loud whether a similarly sized OLED television might actually be better. That question has been burning in my skull for many, many months, but I'm happy to say I finally have an answer.
