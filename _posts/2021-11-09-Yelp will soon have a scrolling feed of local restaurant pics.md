Yelp is joining almost every other site on the internet by giving you a feed to scroll through until you can't scroll no more. Yelp says this feature will be showing up on its users' homepages in almost 150 US metro areas starting today, and that the feed will feature “visual content from local restaurants,” including photos from other Yelpers, posts from restaurant owners, and some popular dishes being served in your area.
