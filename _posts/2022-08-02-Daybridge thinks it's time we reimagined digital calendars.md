Hypothetical question: would you send your date a calendar invite? You've been out, let's say, twice, and you're going to meet for dinner on Friday at 7:30PM. You'd text them that info — you might even tell them over the phone — but would you send them a calendar invite? Or, I'll do you one better: if you haven't picked a time yet, would you send them your Calendly link to find a time to meet? Kieran McHugh, the CEO of a new calendar app company called Daybridge, thinks it's a “no” across the board. But he'd like to change that.
