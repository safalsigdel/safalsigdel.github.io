Twitter announced on Wednesday that its DM search feature has gotten a big upgrade — it can now search through the content of your conversations and return specific messages that contain whatever keyword you type in. Before you could only use it to search for people's names or the names of group chats, but now if you want to find that one conversation you had with a friend about “chili” you can just type it into the search bar.
