Intel is still feeling the burn from the chip shortage. It's struggling to fully capitalize on tremendous pandemic-fueled demand for new PCs, because you can't make a laptop with Intel chips alone. And yet that didn't stop Intel from having its best financial year ever — in today's Q4 2021 earnings, it's reporting its highest quarterly and highest yearly revenue ever, at $19.5 billion and $74.7 billion, respectively — and four other revenue records as well. Profits weren't nearly as rosy: net income went down 21 percent in the quarter and 5 percent year over year to $4.6 billion and $19.9 billion, respectively.
