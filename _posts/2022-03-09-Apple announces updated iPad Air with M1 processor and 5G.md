Apple has announced an update to the iPad Air a year and a half after it gave the tablet an iPad Pro-style redesign. Much of that redesign is still intact, but the new iPad Air model has been updated with a faster M1 processor, first seen in Apple's Macs. It also supports 5G, and the USB-C port is up to twice as fast with 10Gbps of data transfer speeds.
