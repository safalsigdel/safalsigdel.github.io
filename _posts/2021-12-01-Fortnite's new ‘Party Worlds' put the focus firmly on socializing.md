“Party Worlds” are new spaces coming to Fortnite which are designed to focus on socializing over combat, the game's developer Epic Games has announced. “These are experiences that are designed as places for players to hang out, play fun mini-games, and make new friends,” the developer says, adding that Party Worlds cannot be centered on “combat or damage.”
