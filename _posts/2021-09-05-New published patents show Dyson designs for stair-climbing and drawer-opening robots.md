Premium vacuum company Dyson has patented designs for robots that look like they could climb and clean stairs, and open drawers, new filings show. It's not clear whether the designs are for forthcoming products or ideas that are on hold, but Bloomberg reports that Dyson's robotic unit has been working on a robot to interact with other home appliances. Whether it's the robot hand or the stair-climbing robot, or another product entirely also isn't clear at this point.
