Tesla has bucked the wider trend of declining sales brought on by the global chip shortage in the third quarter this year, as it sold 241,300 cars â€” a total of 102,000 more vehicles than the same quarter last year. It's the most Tesla has ever sold in a quarter (and for some added perspective, the company sold 367,500 in all of 2019).
