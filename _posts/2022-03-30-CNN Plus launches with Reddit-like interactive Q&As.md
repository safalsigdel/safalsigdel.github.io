CNN's premium streaming service launches today. The service, CNN Plus, will debut with about a dozen weekly shows, more than a thousand hours of on-demand content, and a Reddit-like interactive tool for asking reporters and guests questions about the day's biggest news. It's a major bet on viewers being willing to pay not just for news but for more news â€” and that the CNN brand can beat out other often freely available options.
