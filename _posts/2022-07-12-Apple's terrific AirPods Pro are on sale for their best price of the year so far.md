If you missed out on buying Apple's AirPods Pro when they were on sale for $159 during Black Friday, you've got another chance at saving big thanks to Amazon's excellent Prime Day deal. Regularly $249, you can buy the AirPods Pro — which we consider to be the best true wireless earbuds for iPhone owners —  for just $169.99, a price that is only $10 shy of the all-time low we saw in November. It's also the lowest price Amazon has offered this year on the outstanding noise-canceling earbuds, which come with a MagSafe-ready charging case, swappable silicon tips for a comfortable fit, and spatial audio support for a more immersive sound experience. Read our AirPods Pro review.
