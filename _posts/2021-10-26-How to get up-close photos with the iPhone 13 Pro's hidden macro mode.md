The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max have great cameras, some of the best you can buy in a phone. They've also got an exclusive new feature Apple never offered before: a macro mode that lets you take extreme close-ups — just two centimeters away! — of intricate things you can barely see with the naked eye. Your pet's incredibly fine fur, the veins of leaves, and the sub-pixels in your computer monitor's screen are all now within reach.
