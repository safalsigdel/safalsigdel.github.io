When Glorious' GMMK Pro was announced a little over a year and a half ago, there was quite a bit of excitement among keyboard enthusiasts. Here was a custom and sleek-looking 75 percent keyboard that made it easy for newcomers to jump into the hobby by providing direct access to all the various parts needed to build it.
