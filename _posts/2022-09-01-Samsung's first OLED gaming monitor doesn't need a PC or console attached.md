Samsung has announced its first OLED gaming monitor, the 34-inch Odyssey OLED G8. It's also one of the company's first gaming monitors we've seen that includes Samsung's Gaming Hub, which lets people stream games from services like Nvidia's GeForce Now, Google Stadia, or Xbox Game Pass without the need for a console or PC. (The feature, which also lets you stream movies from services like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and the recently upgraded Samsung TV Plus, has been available on Samsung's Smart Monitor line, but those aren't really built for gaming.) But while it seems like a totally reasonable display in its own right, there are a few confusing things about it, as well as some important unknowns.
