Yubico has announced a new line of security keys that lets you unlock accounts with a fingerprint. With older YubiKeys, logging in requires putting in a PIN and then tapping the key, but the new version can authenticate with just the tap (though the option to put in a PIN is still available if you're wearing gloves or your fingers are wet). The convenience does come at a premium â€” the USB-A version of the YubiKey Bio costs $80, and the USB-C version costs $85.
