Samsung has released a new camera app in beta that lets you use Pro Mode across all four of the Galaxy S21 Ultra's rear cameras. That means it's supported on both telephoto cameras, rather than being limited to just its main and ultrawide sensors. The new Expert RAW app has been released in the South Korean Galaxy Store, but tipster FrontTron has an APK available to download if you'd like to sideload it. It only seems to be available for the S21 Ultra for now, on devices running Android 12.
