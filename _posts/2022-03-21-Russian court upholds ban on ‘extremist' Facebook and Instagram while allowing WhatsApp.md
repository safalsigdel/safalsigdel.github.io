A judge in the Tverskoy Court of Moscow has ruled to ban Meta based on Facebook and Instagram for engaging in “extremist activities,” according to a report from Russian state-owned media outlet TASS. The ban will block Meta from doing business or opening new branches in the country and will take effect “immediately.” It doesn't include WhatsApp.
