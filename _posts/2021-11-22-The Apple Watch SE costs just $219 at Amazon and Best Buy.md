A proverbial tidal wave of deals crashed down this morning, heralding the beginning of Black Friday week. As I searched for deals to include in this roundup, I kept finding one after the other that was better. If you think these are good, consider acting fast, as it's impossible to tell if they'll stick around all week or if they're just a flash in the pan. The very best discount that kicked off recently is a big $60 discount on the Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS) at Best Buy and Amazon. Regularly selling for $279, it's just $219 â€” the lowest price yet. If you want the larger 44mm-sized model, it's $249 instead of $309. You can shop all of the sizes and colorways right here at Best Buy.
