The first embroidery stitch Marxc3xada Mxc3xa9ndez Rodrxc3xadguez learned at the age of 7 was the chain stitch. It's the same one that, years later, she would teach to her seven children. At 42, Mxc3xa9ndez has mastered advanced stitches like the closed buttonhole and rococo. She's now diving back into the drawing process, trying to evolve from the traditional motifs of flowers and leaves she embroiders on blouses to better reflect the flora in her community.
