Amazon's new smart thermostat just received its first-ever price break. Normally, this thermostat costs $59.99 but is currently on sale for $47.99 at Amazon. It's the best price we've seen yet for this particular device, and considering it didn't get a discount during Black Friday, this sale may not last.
