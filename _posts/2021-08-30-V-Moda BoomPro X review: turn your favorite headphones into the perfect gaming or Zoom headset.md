There's something to be said for cheap, simple gadgets. The BoomPro is a smart idea that's executed almost perfectly. With a single cable, you get a microphone (with a flexible arm for easy repositioning), volume controls, and a mute switch. It can substitute for the 3.5mm audio cable that you'd normally plug into your favorite wireless headphones, immediately transforming them into a much better communication tool.
