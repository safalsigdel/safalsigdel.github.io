Beats has been busy. After releasing the Studio Buds earlier this year, today the Apple-owned brand is back with the more premium Beats Fit Pro wireless earbuds. It's unusual to see two completely new products from Beats in a single year, but perhaps the company is trying to make a point that it's not idly sitting by and playing second fiddle to Apple's AirPods and AirPods Pro. If anything, the $200 Fit Pros demonstrate that Beats has found its focus.
