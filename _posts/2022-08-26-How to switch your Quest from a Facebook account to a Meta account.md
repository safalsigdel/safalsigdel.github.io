If you've bought an Meta (formerly known as Oculus) Quest or Quest 2 virtual reality headset in the past few years, you've likely had to set it up using a Facebook account. While that makes sense given that the device is made by Meta, Facebook's parent company, there are a few potential downsides to having your Facebook account and Quest linked. For example, if your account gets banned because of something that happens on Facebook, you may lose access to the games you've purchased for Oculus.
