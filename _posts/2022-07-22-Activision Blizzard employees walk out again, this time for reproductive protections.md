Activision Blizzard employees will participate in yet another walkout today, this time over concerns about employee safety in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Organized by A Better ABK, Activision Blizzard's internal employee rights advocacy group, the walkout will take place at four of the publisher's North American offices: California, Texas, Minnesota, and New York, where a new QA worker's union was just organized.
