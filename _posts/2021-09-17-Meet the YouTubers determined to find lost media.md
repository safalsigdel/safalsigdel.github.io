When I was 11, I remember seeing a weird commercial on television. During the commercial break of a Slamball rerun (remember Slamball?) on Cartoon Network, I saw an AIDS awareness ad. It was made specifically for kids, and it was accompanied by an annoying rap. I distinctly remember the chorus: “What do you know about AIDS?!” It's been stuck in my head for years. I guess you're expecting me to link the commercial I'm describing, right? Well, I can't, because I've never found it. I've never even seen it mentioned online. This commercial is what's known as “lost media.”
