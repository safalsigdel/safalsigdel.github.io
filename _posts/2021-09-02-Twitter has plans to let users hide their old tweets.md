Twitter is planning new features to give people more privacy options, according to Bloomberg. The social network's plans reportedly include the option to archive old tweets so they're not visible to other users after a given period of time (like 30, 60, or 90 days or a full year). They also include possible options to limit who can see which tweets you've liked, to let people remove themselves from a conversation on Twitter, and to let people remove followers without outright blocking them.
