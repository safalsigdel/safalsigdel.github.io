Google is bringing an update to older Pixel devices to fix a dangerous bug that prevents users from calling 911, as noted by a post on a Google support page. The bug stems from an unintended interaction between the Android OS and Microsoft Teams â€” it only affects devices with Android 10 or later and could occur if you have Teams installed but aren't signed in.
