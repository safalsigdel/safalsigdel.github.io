A year after The Wall Street Journal reported Amazon had an interest in using empty mall spaces as fulfillment centers, the business paper is back with a rumor that Amazon is planning to open department store-style locations of its own. The reported plan is for stores that are smaller than your average 100,000-square-foot Macy's or JC Penney location, with a footprint that's only about 30,000 square feet, which is closer to the size of Kohl's stores that already handle Amazon returns. Without specific information on what they might sell, they could stock clothing, electronics, and household items.
