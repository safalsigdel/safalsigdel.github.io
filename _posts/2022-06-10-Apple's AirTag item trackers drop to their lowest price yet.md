If you're an iPhone owner planning on traveling this summer, today's deal on Apple AirTag location trackers has arrived at the perfect time. Right now, you can buy Apple's ultra wideband-capable Bluetooth tracker to keep track of your luggage and other items for just $24 instead of $29 from Amazon and Best Buy (until 10PM PT today or June 10th at 1AM ET). That might be a small discount, but it's also a rare one and the best price we've seen.
