Sony's PlayStation 5 has not been nearly as hard to get as it once was. With a mix of increased supply and easing demand, it's almost easy to get one â€” even if you don't yet see rows of them in stock at USA stores. However, Walmart is running another one of its restock events for paying Walmart Plus subscribers. The major retailer will have the standard disc-equipped PlayStation 5 Horizon Forbidden West bundle for $549 today at 3PM ET / 12PM PT.
