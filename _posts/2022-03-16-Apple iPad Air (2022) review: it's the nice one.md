Much of the new iPad Air from Apple is a known quantity. The design, screen, speakers, rear camera, and fingerprint scanner are all carried over from the 2020 model. The updated front-facing camera with Apple's Center Stage feature can be found across the entire iPad line. It's compatible with all the same cases, keyboard, and stylus accessories as before. And the M1 chip inside the new Air is lifted right from last year's iPad Pro and the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and iMac.
