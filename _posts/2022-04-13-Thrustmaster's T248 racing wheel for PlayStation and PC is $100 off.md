If you're a fan of racing games, Thrustmaster's T248 steering wheel and pedal setup is a nice way to make the experience feel more immersive. Designed for both PlayStation consoles and PC, it's a great all-in-one package that can help beginners get started with a racing setup, one that requires little in the way of preparation. It's an even better buy today given it's currently on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo for $299.99 instead of $399.99, a new all-time low.
