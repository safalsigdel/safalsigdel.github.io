The new Apple Watch Series 7 was announced alongside the iPhone 13, iPad, and iPad Mini, but it's the final device in Apple's new lineup to launch. This newer model sits atop Apple's current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration â€” each with optional cellular radios if you want to pay for service with your carrier.
