Microsoft is announcing a new Xbox Elite 2 Core controller today, and it's priced at $50 less than the existing Xbox Elite 2. The Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 xe2x80x93 Core (yes, that's the full name!) is available for preorder today for $129.99, but it doesn't include the usual interchangeable components â€” you'll have to purchase those separately.
