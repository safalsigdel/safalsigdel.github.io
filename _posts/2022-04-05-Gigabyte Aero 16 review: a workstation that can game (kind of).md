Gigabyte's Aero is a model the company has long touted as a creator-specific line. I've always been a bit skeptical there. Gigabyte is known far and wide as a gaming company, and Aero models, despite their branding, tend not to look too different from the company's Aorus gaming lineup. Outside of Dell's XPS line, Windows-based “creator laptops” are typically known to be gaming laptops in slightly smaller and less RGB-laden chassis.
