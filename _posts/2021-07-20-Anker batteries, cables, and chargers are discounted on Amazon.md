Whether you're gearing up for the back-to-school season or just looking for some extra charging kits to make your vacation go a little smoother, Anker's latest discounts at Amazon might have what you're looking for. There are a handful of products on sale, including a three-pack of iPhone cables (USB-A-to-Lightning) for $19.49 instead of $30, and a clever power strip with two outlets and three USB ports (two USB-A ports and one USB-C 18W PD port) for $26 instead of $36. There's also a 15W Qi wireless charging pad available for $20 instead of $30, but it doesn't include a power adapter.
