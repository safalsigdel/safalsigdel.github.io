Apex Legends continues to hold its players' attention even after several years on the market, and next week, the battle royale shooter will bring things back to where they started with a new season that revisits the game's original map. This year, the game already added two new characters (plus two more in the new mobile version), brought upgrades for next-gen consoles, rotated in a well-received Control game mode, and, according to EA's earnings call this week, notched double-digit income growth again for the last quarter. On the other hand, player complaints over glitches, ranked mode scoring, matchmaking, and practically any other small detail continue to mount.
