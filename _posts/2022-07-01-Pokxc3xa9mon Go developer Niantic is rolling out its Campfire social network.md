Pokxc3xa9mon Go maker Niantic has made a social app for its games — and it's coming out very soon. The developer says that the app, called Campfire, will kick off its global rollout “in the coming days.” Campfire was originally announced in May and has been in a testing phase with Ingress players over the last few months. The initial rollout will be available for “select groups of Pokxc3xa9mon Go players throughout the summer,” according to the developer.
