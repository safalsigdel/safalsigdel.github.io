I live in South Carolina, where the mosquito is the unofficial state bird. There are at least 61 different species of the bloodsuckers here, and I loathe each and every one of them. Beyond the itchiness, they spread serious diseases and can even transmit heartworm to cats and dogs. I've tried everything to combat the biters, but I still get eaten alive in my backyard. I think it's my rare English blood they love. (My husband hardly gets a bite.)
