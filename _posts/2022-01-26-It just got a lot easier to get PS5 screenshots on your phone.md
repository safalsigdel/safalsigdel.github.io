Sony is making it a lot easier to share your PS5 screenshots outside of your PS5. The company appears to finally be rolling out a way to have screenshots and videos captured on your PS5 auto-upload to the PlayStation app, where you can save them to your camera roll for whatever you might need. This feature was first tested in Canada and Japan in October, but it became available for me in the US on Tuesday.
