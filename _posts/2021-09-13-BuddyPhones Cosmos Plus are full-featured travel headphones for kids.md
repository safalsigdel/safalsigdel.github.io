In my home, headphones for my kids tend to be a hand-me-down affair. When I've upgraded to something newer or better, I pass down my old cans to my kids to use with their tablets or Chromebooks. But this is less than ideal for a variety of reasons: the older headphones might be lacking features like Bluetooth or noise cancellation; what fits my oversized head likely won't sit comfortably on their kid-sized domes; and standard headphones don't have a way to limit their maximum volume, which can lead to hearing loss in children.
