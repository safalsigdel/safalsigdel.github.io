Instagram will roll out new parental control features on its platform in March, the service's head Adam Mosseri has announced in a blog post. They'll allow parents and guardians to see how much time their teenagers spend on Instagram, set time limits, and get notified if their child reports someone. The controls were announced as a package of new features designed to make the platform a safer place, particularly for its teenage users.
