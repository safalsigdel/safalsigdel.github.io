Your phone's lock screen is the hottest new real estate in tech. Apple made the iPhone's lock screen a centerpiece of iOS 16, giving users more control over how theirs looks and works. But while Apple talked about pretty clock fonts and nifty color-matched wallpapers, it also showed off a world in which your lock screen is more than just a security measure; it's becoming another surface on which companies can put information, apps, and even ads. Apple's far from the only company thinking about this, too. TechCrunch reports that Glance, a lock screen content company (which apparently is a thing!), is already in talks with US carriers and plans to launch on some Android phones in the US in the next two months.
