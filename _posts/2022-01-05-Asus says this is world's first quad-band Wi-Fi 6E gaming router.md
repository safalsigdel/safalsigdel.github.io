Asus' latest router is the ROG Rapture GT-AXE16000, and it says it's the “world's first quad-band Wi-Fi 6E gaming router.” That doesn't quite make it the world's first quad-band Wi-Fi 6E router overall (Netgear announced a quad-band Orbi system last October which you can already buy), but this is the first such system to specifically target gamers, and as a standalone router its starting price is cheaper than comparable mesh systems.
