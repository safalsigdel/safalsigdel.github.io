Google is adding a new “highly cited” label to search results frequently sourced by other publications, the company is announcing today. Anything from local news stories, to interviews, announcements, and even press releases will be eligible for the new label being added to the search result's preview image, so long as other websites are linking to it. More info is also being added to Search's “rapidly evolving topics” and “About this Result” notices.
