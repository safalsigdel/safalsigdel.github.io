Almost anything becomes a little more appealing once the price goes down. Take HP's Chromebook x2 11 tablet, for example. It's currently selling for $299.99 at Best Buy, a price cut that's mighty enough to outweigh its flaws. This one-day deal on the 11-inch tablet with Chrome OS makes for a much more compelling argument compared to its $599.99 regular price. When our own Dan Seifert reviewed the Chromebook x2 in December 2021, he scored it a 5.5 out of 10 due to its occasionally choppy performance. But for half price, it seems like a good deal.
