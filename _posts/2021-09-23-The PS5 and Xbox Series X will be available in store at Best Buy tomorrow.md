For the most part, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have been sold exclusively online since their launch in late 2020, but that's changing, at least a little bit, starting tomorrow. Best Buy will stock the next-gen consoles — specifically, the disc-based PS5, PS5 Digital Edition, and Xbox Series X — in several of its US stores, and getting one will be similar to the process the retailer uses for selling graphics cards in person. You'll need to show up early and form a queue, then, at 7:30AM local time, Best Buy employees will hand out one ticket per customer for as many consoles as each store has in stock.
