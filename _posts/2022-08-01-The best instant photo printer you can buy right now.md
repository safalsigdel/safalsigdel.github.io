Instant photo printers are sort of the quieter, less-cool sibling of instant cameras, but they're arguably more practical. They don't quite tap into the nostalgia-fueled fun of pulling out an Instax camera at a party, but they're a more versatile means of getting to the final product: a real, live photo print you can touch and feel. In an age where virtually all of our photos live in digital storage on our devices or on social media feeds, a physical print is kind of magic.
