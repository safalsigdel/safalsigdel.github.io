By the magnitude of its $2,400 price alone, the Devialet Dione soundbar comes with sky-high expectations. This ultra-premium Dolby Atmos bar is a solo performer: it doesn't come with a separate subwoofer, nor does Diavelet even sell such a thing. At 26.5 pounds and measuring nearly four feet wide, it's a hulking piece of home theater equipment that's considerably heavier than Sony's HT-A7000 â€” let alone something like the Sonos Arc.
