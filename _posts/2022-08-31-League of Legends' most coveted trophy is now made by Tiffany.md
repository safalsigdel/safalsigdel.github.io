The Summoner's Cup is arguably the most iconic trophy in all of esports — and now it has a totally new look. The trophy is the prize for the annual world champion in League of Legends, and developer Riot Games teamed up with jewelry brand Tiffany & Co. to refresh its look. The trophy is made of a combination of sterling silver, fine silver, stainless steel, brass, and wood and weighs in at 44 pounds. It also features a new section with the names of previous champions engraved on the bottom, sort of like the video game equivalent of the Stanley Cup.
