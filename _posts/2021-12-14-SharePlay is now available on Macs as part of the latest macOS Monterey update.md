Apple has brought SharePlay to the Mac as part of macOS Monterey 12.1, which was released Monday. With SharePlay, you can now enjoy entertainment like movies, music, and games synchronized with your friends over FaceTime while on your Mac. (You can see a list of some supported apps here.) And if you want to share your screen with your group, SharePlay supports that as well. My colleague Monica Chin ran into some issues with SharePlay on Mac while the feature was in beta, however, so hopefully it works more smoothly now that it's available widely.
