Apple has quietly introduced a new option for its third-generation non-Pro AirPods â€” a Lightning-only charging case (via MacRumors). On the surface, that's reasonable: forgoing wireless charging on the second-gen AirPods saved you $40. But this time around, you're only saving ten dollars: they cost $169, compared to $179 for the MagSafe version (which can also be charged with a Lightning cable).
