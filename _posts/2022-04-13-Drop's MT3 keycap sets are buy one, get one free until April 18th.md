There's nothing better than some extra clickity-clackity deals on colorful mechanical keyboard accessories â€” well, to me at least. Drop is once again here with another buy one, get one free deal on base or ortholinear kits of its exclusive MT3 keycaps. This is the return of a deal we saw in February, though there has been a restock of select colorways that quickly sold out of stock last time around, like the Cyber set by designer MiTo. Most keycap sets run $110 to $120 for a base kit that includes your essential keys for most boards. Add two sets to your cart and use the code MT3BOGORETURNS at checkout, and the second set of equal or lesser value becomes free.
