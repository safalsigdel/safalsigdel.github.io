If you know where to look, there are often some great discounts available on Apple's popular — yet oftentimes expensive — AirPods. Since Apple launched the third-gen AirPods last year, we've seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. And now that you can preorder the second-gen AirPods Pro, we'll likely start seeing discounts on the last-gen Pro and other models, including the over-ear AirPods Max.
