Valve shared yesterday that its official docking station made to pipe the Steam Deck's visuals to a TV or monitor (and connect a couple of USB peripherals) has been delayed yet again. The dock missed its initial launch window of shipping alongside the first batch of Deck reservations in late February, and a mix of ongoing part shortages and COVID-related work stoppages has pushed its release further into the future. Valve didn't share when it's aiming to release the dock, though it says it's “working on improving the situation.”
