Asus always finds a way to surprise me. It's a company that can produce the elegant ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15 gaming laptops â€” up there with the best in the business in terms of design and thinness. It can also make the Flow Z13, a thin gaming tablet with powerful specs inside. Then, it can go completely in the opposite direction to make something like the Strix Scar 17, a powerful but far less refined laptop that starts at $1,999 and goes up from there. I would say that it's a device made explicitly for gamers, but I know plenty of gamers who wouldn't want to be seen using this thing.
