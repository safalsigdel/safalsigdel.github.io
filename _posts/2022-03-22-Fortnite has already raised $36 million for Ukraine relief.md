On Sunday, Epic Games released a new season of Fortnite and, with it, a promise that for two weeks, all of its proceeds from the game would go towards humanitarian relief for Ukraine. One day later, the developer revealed that it has already raised $36 million as part of the effort. The money is being donated to a handful of different aid groups, including Direct Relief, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children's Fund, and the World Food Programme. Epic says that Xbox is also donating its net proceeds from the game during the same period.
