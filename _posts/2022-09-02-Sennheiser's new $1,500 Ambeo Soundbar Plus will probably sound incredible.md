When it comes to getting the most immersive audio presentation from a standalone soundbar, no one has managed to outclass Sennheiser's Ambeo. And considering that device's sky-high $2,500 price, you'd expect it to deliver a sublime home theater experience. At IFA 2022, Sennheiser is adding to the Ambeo lineup by introducing the new Ambeo Soundbar Plus. The price is slightly lower but will likely still leave this one out of reach for many consumers. It costs $1,499.95, and preorders begin today.
