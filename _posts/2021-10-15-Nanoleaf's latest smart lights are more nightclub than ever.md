First, there were triangles; then there were squares. Next came hexagons, and now, say hello to lines. No, this isn't your sixth grader's geometry homework. It's the latest addition to smart lighting maker Nanoleaf's ever-growing catalog of modular LED light panels. The new Nanoleaf Lines are ultra-lightweight, color-changing lights in a bar shape. Backlit, they connect at 60-degree angles to create geometric designs of your choosing, and with dual-color zones, the Lines ($199.99) can add a visual feast to any wall or ceiling.
