Halo Infinite's co-op campaign and Forge mode, which won't be in the game when it officially releases on December 8th, are going to launch even later than previously expected. In an interview with Eurogamer, Halo Infinite head of creative Joseph Staten reiterated that campaign co-op would launch with season 2, but since season 1 was extended by three months to May 2022 this week, that means the second season is at least half a year away.
