If you've been waiting for a sizable deal on the new M1 processor-equipped 12.9-inch iPad Pro or the 10.9-inch iPad Air released last year, you can save $100 on either model now at Amazon. Starting with the iPad Pro, the base model in space gray that comes with 128GB of storage costs $999 at Amazon. That's $100 off the usual cost, which is great considering this iteration includes a brilliant Mini LED Liquid Retina XDR display with more contrast and color depth than in previous models.
