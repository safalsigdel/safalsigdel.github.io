Spotify has released its eagerly anticipated Wrapped experience revealing the most listened to artists and albums for (most of) 2021. This year, it's adding even more social media-friendly features that help you share your favorite music with a customized movie, aura, or playing cards. Naturally, you can share Spotify's auto-created images on your timeline and, for the first time, directly to TikTok. It's sure to spark discussions with friends and provide valuable marketing for Spotify that competitors like Apple and YouTube can't seem to match.
