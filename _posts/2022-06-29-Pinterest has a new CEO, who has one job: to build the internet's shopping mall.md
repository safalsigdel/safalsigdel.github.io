Ben Silbermann is stepping down as Pinterest's CEO, the company announced on Tuesday. He'll be replaced by Bill Ready, who has spent the last couple of years as head of Commerce, Payments & Next Billion Users at Google. Silbermann isn't leaving the company, though: he'll be Pinterest's executive chairman, following in the path of a number of tech CEOs who have recently gone from the daily trenches of running their company to a relatively more relaxed seat in the boardroom.
