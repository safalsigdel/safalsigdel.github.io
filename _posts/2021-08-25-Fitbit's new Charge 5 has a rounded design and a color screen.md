Following a couple of big leaks, Fitbit is officially announcing the Charge 5, the company's latest fitness tracker, and it marks one of the biggest design changes to the popular Charge family since the first Charge HR, which came out in 2015. The Charge 5 shaves down the hard angles that have defined the Charge trackers for a more rounded look, and more significantly, it's the first Charge with a color AMOLED display.
