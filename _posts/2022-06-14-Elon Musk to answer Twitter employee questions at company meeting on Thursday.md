Elon Musk will attend a virtual all-hands meeting with Twitter employees this Thursday, during which he'll field questions from the company he's in the process of buying. His attendance was announced in an email from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal on Monday seen by Business Insider. Employees will be able to submit questions in advance of the meeting. It will be the first time Musk has addressed Twitter's nervous employees directly since announcing plans for the $44 billion takeover.
