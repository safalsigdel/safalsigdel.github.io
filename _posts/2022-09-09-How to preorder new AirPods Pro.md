Apple's “Far Out” event on Wednesday introduced a number of devices to Apple's existing product lineup, including the iPhone 14, a ruggedized Apple Watch, and an updated version of the AirPods Pro. The second-gen AirPods Pro will launch on September 23rd for $249.99 and are available to preorder now. Apple will continue to sell the entry-level AirPods at their original price of $179; however, it appears Apple is discontinuing the original AirPods Pro with the release of the second-gen model.
