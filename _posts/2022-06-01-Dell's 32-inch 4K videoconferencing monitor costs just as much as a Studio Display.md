Dell has finally revealed the $1,599.99 price attached to the UltraSharp 32-inch 4K video conferencing monitor it previewed at CES (via 9to5Mac). If that price sounds familiar, it's because Apple's 27-inch Studio Display costs almost the exact same amount â€” only Dell justifies the price with the monitor's size and its camera sensor, while Apple's sales pitch leans on that still-rare 5K resolution.
