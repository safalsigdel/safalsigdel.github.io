Things start out rather quaint and cozy in the latest trailer for Men — directed by Alex Garland, best known for his work on Annihilation and Ex Machina — but that feeling doesn't last long. It starts with an uncomfortable joke and then gets progressively more unsettling from there, before eventually descending into full-blown psychological horror.
