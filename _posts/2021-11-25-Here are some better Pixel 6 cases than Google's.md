As wonderful as the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are, their smooth glass backs are extremely slippery, as Dan Seifert mentioned in his review. And the official Google frosted recycled plastic cases are not great solutions, thanks to their cheap feel and still slippery finish. So, where does that leave you, the new owner of Google's flagship phone? You can't just leave your pristine new phone naked. That's why we've rounded up some third-party cases that befit the Pixel's unique design, whether you're looking for a case for yourself or gifting a case to a new Pixel 6 owner. Just be aware that cases may be out of stock or slow to ship, so you'll need a lot of luck and patience to find your ideal case this holiday season.
