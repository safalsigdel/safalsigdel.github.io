It's been almost a year since we told you how next-gen USB-C cables would nearly double the amount of power they can carry to 240W, enough to let you ditch the proprietary power brick for all but the beefiest gaming laptops. Now, we're seeing the first signs of life: the first USB-C 2.1 cables have broken cover with up to 240W of power and up to 40Gbps of data. They're from a Dutch manufacturer named Club3D (via Tom's Hardware) that doesn't sell cables on its website, and they don't yet seem to be in stock at retailers yet either.
