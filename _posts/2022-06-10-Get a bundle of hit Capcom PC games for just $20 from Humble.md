If you're hyped up today for gaming news, there's a very special deal running now that you should check out. Humble has a new bundle collecting a whole slew of big Capcom hits from the last few years, including some remastered PS2-era classics. Some of the most notable include Street Fighter V, Devil May Cry 5, and Monster Hunter: World. As is often the case with a Humble bundle, proceeds go to charities, the developers, and Humble itself. This one has contributions going toward the ACLU and The Trevor Project.
