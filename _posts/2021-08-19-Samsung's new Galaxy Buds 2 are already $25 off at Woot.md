Samsung announced the Galaxy Buds 2 wireless earbuds last week, so it's a surprise that Woot is already offering a sizable discount on them. Normally priced at $150, you can snag a set in the graphite, white, lavender, or olive colorways for $125. In case you were worried there might be a catch â€” well, there is one. These don't come with a Samsung warranty. Instead, you'll get a 90-day warranty through Woot against hardware defects. If that's not a deal-breaker for you, this could be a deal that's worth jumping on.
