Backbone Labs has acknowledged the issue that hampers the use of its excellent iPhone gaming controller with the new iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. As we noticed last week, the iPhone 13 Pro's thicker camera bump means the phone doesn't sit neatly in the Backbone One controller, either sticking out on one side or causing the bridge on the back to slightly buckle. It's not unusable, but it's not great.
