Nvidia is making its top GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership tier available on a monthly basis. The service, which uses RTX 3080-level hardware to stream games from Steam or Epic Games Store, will now be available for $19.99 per month. That means you can try out the top RTX 3080 tier for a month, instead of signing up to the service for six months.
