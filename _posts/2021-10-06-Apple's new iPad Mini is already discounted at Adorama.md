At $499, the latest iPad Mini isn't cheap. Luckily, Adorama is currently taking $25 off of the 64GB, Wi-Fi-equipped model in all four colorways, bringing the final sale price down to $474. The latest model is equipped with Apple's new A15 Bionic processor and a 12MP rear camera, not to mention Apple's Center Stage feature, which allows the front-facing camera to digitally pan and zoom in order to keep you in the frame.
