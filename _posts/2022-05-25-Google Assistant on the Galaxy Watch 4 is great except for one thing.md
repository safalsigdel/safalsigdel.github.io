When Google and Samsung announced Wear OS 3 last year, I had lots of questions about how well Google services would run on Samsung hardware. Of Google's expansive suite of apps, I was most curious about Google Assistant. The only catch was it wasn't available when the Galaxy Watch 4 lineup launched â€” and there were only vague promises as to when it would actually be available. But yesterday, Google Assistant finally arrived on the Galaxy Watch 4, and after a few hours of playing around with it, I'm cautiously optimistic.
