Sony's new WF-C500 true wireless earbuds have an appealing price of $99.99 and come with a sleeker, more traditional design than the WF-XB700 buds that they're replacing. Aside from the reined-in looks, they improve upon that model by adding support for Sony's Headphones Connect app, which allows you to customize the EQ to your liking. The WF-XB700s had the company's “Extra Bass” branding, but Sony has done away with that this time for a sound that's much more balanced out of the box. Battery life has also improved slightly to an impressive 10 hours of continuous playback, and the C500s offer easy-to-use controls with large buttons on each earbud.
