Microsoft is listening. The Surface Duo 2 ditches its predecessor's last-gen specs, the Surface Laptop Studio does away with the Surface Book's gimmicky detachable screen, and the Surface Pro 8 might be the one we've been waiting for, with an enhanced keyboard, stylus, high-refresh rate screen and Thunderbolt ports (finally!). But there's one place where Microsoft is stubbornly carrying on: making you pay substantially more than the quoted sticker price to use these computers as advertised â€” because none of them include a stylus or keyboard.
