Before there were commercials and whole branding exercises hailing the notch on the Apple iPhone, there was a long row of iPhone XS devices in the lobby of the Steve Jobs Theater. The iPhone XS was part of the second generation of notched iPhones, so it was all kind of about the notch — but it was also about the fancy OLED display that showed off perfect blacks compared to the XR's traditional LED. Which is why Apple put a vibrant wallpaper with bright pops of color on the XS and the notch disappeared into the perfect black of the OLED display. There was something timid about the choice to hide it in the wallpaper, like Apple wasn't quite as confident of its now fairly iconic screen cutout. With the iPhone 14 Pro, it looks like Apple has finally figured it out.
