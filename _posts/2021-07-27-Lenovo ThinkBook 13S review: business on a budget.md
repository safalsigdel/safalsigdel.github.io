Priced a tier below Lenovo's world-class ThinkPads, the ThinkBook 13S targets small- and medium-sized companies and business users looking for a less snazzy device at a lower cost. But the ThinkBook's price tag shouldn't fool you â€” it's a contender. And I'm impressed by the package the ThinkBook offers for its sub-$1,000 price, which includes solid performance from Intel's 11th Gen processors, a high-resolution 16:10 screen, and surprisingly good audio. For everyday work use, it more than gets the job done.
