Airbnb announced that it's changing the way guest profiles are displayed in its app — for Oregon residents specifically. Airbnb hosts who are based in Oregon will now see a potential guest's initials, rather than their full name, until after they've confirmed that guest's booking request. The change will fully roll out by January 31st.
