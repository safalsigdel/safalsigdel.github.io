Alienware is releasing a pair of new gaming monitors, including a 25-incher with a 360Hz variable refresh rate and a 27-inch Quad HD option that can overclock to 280Hz. Both monitors sport leaner designs than the brand's other recent offerings, with smaller bases and slide-out headset stands, giving users more desk real estate for massive desk pads and full-sized keyboards.
