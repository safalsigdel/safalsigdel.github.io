Microsoft is bringing back its weather widget on the Windows 11 taskbar. It's a feature that originally debuted in Windows 10, providing live weather conditions and quick access to the broader widget and news feed. Windows 11 removed this taskbar integration in favor of a separate widgets panel, though.
