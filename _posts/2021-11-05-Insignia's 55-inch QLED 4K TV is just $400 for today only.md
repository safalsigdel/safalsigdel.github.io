If you're in need of an affordable 4K TV that punches above its price class before the Black Friday shopping craze begins, Insignia's F50 QLED 4K TV might be exactly what you're after. Normally $650, it's just $400 at Best Buy and Amazon. The F50 is one of the company's latest models, and it's a big upgrade over its previous Fire TV Edition models. The F50 still features Amazon's Fire TV software built in, with the ever-helpful Alexa just a button press and ping word away, but it has slimmer bezels, and its panel supports quantum dot HDR technology. With it, the TV should provide better color accuracy, more vivid contrast, and more realistic lighting.
