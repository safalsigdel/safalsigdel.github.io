Apple has just announced the latest version of its most popular tablet: the standard iPad. This new model is the ninth generation of the iPad that first debuted in 2010, and it features a new processor called the A13 Bionic. Additionally, there's a new 12-megapixel front camera that supports the Center Stage feature that debuted with the iPad Pro last year. The rest of the 9th Gen iPad will look very familiar to anyone who has seen an iPad in the past few years, complete with the same home button, bezels, single rear camera, and Lightning port we've seen before.
