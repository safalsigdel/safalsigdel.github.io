Sony seems to be close to making it a lot easier to share PS5 screenshots outside of your console. The company had appeared to be rolling out a way to have screenshots and videos captured on your PS5 auto-upload to the PlayStation app but now it's gone. Sony began testing the feature in Canada and Japan in October, and it became available for me in the US on Tuesday night, but less than 24 hours later I am unable to use it.
