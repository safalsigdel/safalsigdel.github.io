Facebook is slowing down the release and development of some new products and features to make sure they won't bring more scrutiny towards the company or harm children, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. The “reputational reviews” come as Facebook is facing backlash from the public and policymakers after a wave of reports citing Facebook's own research showing ways Instagram could have a negative effect on teen girls' mental health. Facebook was also slammed in congressional hearings by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shed more light on Facebook's internal research, as well as its business model and algorithms.
