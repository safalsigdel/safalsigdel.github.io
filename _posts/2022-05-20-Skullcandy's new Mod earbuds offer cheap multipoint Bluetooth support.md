Skullcandy is continuing its trend of inexpensive, feature-rich earbuds with its latest offering, the Mod earbuds. All of the standard fare is present here with IP55 weatherproofing and USB-C charging. The Mods also manage to pack in multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, which, as the name might suggest, lets you connect and listen to multiple devices at the same time. This isn't a new feature to earbuds in general, but when those earbuds only cost $60, it's definitely worthy of attention.
