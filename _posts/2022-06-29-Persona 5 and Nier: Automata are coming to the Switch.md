The Nintendo Switch is getting some big-name roleplaying games. At a Nintendo Direct Mini today, Nintendo revealed that Persona 5 Royal (along with its predecessors Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden) will be coming to the Switch. Persona 5 is launching on October 21st and will be preceded by Nier: Automata on October 6th. Both are seminal RPGs that originally launched in 2017; you can check out our original reviews of P5 and Automata. (Nintendo says to expect more details on Persona 3 and 4 “soon.”)
