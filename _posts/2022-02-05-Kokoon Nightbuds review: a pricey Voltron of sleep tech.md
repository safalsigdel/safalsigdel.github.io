I know what I want from a sleep gadget. I want something that's going to help me drift off to slumberland, mask my husband's snoring, wake me up on time, and tell me how well I slept. So far, most sleep tech I've tested falls into two categories: health trackers meant to track the quality of your sleep and audio-based devices meant to help you fall (and stay) asleep. I've yet to find a single device that merges these two categories well. So I was cautiously optimistic about finding the $249.99 Kokoon Nightbuds — a pair of earbuds that promises to do all this, with some added perks like adaptive audio and the ability to choose your own content.
