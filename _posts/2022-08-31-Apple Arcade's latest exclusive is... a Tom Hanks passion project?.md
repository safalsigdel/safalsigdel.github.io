Hanx101 Trivia, a trivia game that is narrated by actor Tom Hanks, will soon be one of the games exclusively available on the Apple Arcade subscription service (via Variety). Despite the name, it's not a game dedicated to quizzing you about Hanks' career — a press release from the game's developer, Blueline Studios, says it'll feature “tens of thousands of questions” about subjects like history, math, geography, and food. (I'm hoping the later set contains at least one question about a box of chocolate.)
