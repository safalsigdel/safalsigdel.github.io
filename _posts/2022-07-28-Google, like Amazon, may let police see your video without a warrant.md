Arlo, Apple, Wyze, and Anker, owner of Eufy, all confirmed to CNET that they won't give authorities access to your smart home camera's footage unless they're shown a warrant or court order. If you're wondering why they're specifying that, it's because we've now learned Google and Amazon can do just the opposite: they'll allow police to get this data without a warrant if police claim there's been an emergency. And while Google says that it hasn't used this power, Amazon's admitted to doing it almost a dozen times this year.
