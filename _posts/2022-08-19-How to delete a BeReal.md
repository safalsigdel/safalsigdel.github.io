BeReal is a fun app. But one of its less fun qualities is the element of surprise. You don't see a preview of yourself while the front-facing camera is shooting, and you don't know exactly when it's taking your picture. As a consequence, if you're in a hurry or otherwise distracted, you may end up posting a photo that you're unhappy with for the world to see.
