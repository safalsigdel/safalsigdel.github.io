After extensive leaks and teases, Oppo has officially announced the Find X5 Pro, its flagship phone for 2022. It's a fairly iterative follow-up to last year's Find X3 Pro, but that was a great phone, and after spending more than a week with a not-yet-final version of its successor I'm expecting the same to hold true.
