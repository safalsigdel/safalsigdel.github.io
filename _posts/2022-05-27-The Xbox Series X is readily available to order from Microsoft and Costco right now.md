If you're on the hunt for the Xbox Series X, we may currently have a brief respite from some of the blink-and-you'll-miss-it console restocks. The flagship Xbox has never been quite as difficult to get as a PlayStation 5, but at times, it flirted with being readily available. Right now, we have one of those lulls where a couple retailers have the Xbox Series X available to order without much fuss. Costco members can get it in a bundle with an additional controller for $549.99, and anyone can freely order the standalone console for $499.99 direct from Microsoft.
