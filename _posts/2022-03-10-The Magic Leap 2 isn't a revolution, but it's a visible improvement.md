I'm looking at a mountain range projected on a wooden table. The mountain range isn't part of a flashy game or art project. I can't reach out and touch it like a real object. Thanks to some still-in-progress software optimization, it glitches a little when I move. And I'll never purchase the high-end augmented reality headset that's creating the illusion â€” the Magic Leap 2, set for launch later this year. But the scene is remarkable for an important reason: I can actually see all of it at once.
