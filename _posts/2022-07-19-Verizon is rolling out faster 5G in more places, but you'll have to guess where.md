Verizon says that customers in “many markets across the US” could get significantly faster 5G speeds, even when they're not right next to a cell tower. According to a press release on Monday, this is possible because Verizon's deploying extra C-band spectrum; for some areas, the carrier's now using 100 MHz of bandwidth instead of 60 MHz. The company says some engineers got blazing fast download speeds of 1.4 Gigabits per second when they were “near active cell sites,” which dropped down to a (still very fast) 500 Mbps after they moved “further away from the towers.”
