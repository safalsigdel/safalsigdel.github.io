YouTube Music will now attempt to suggest which of your Cast-enabled speakers you want to stream music to. It's a nice upgrade over the previous approach, where the app would simply list all of the Cast-enabled devices on your network in alphabetical order. If you're anything like us, that could mean having to hunt through a list of half a dozen speakers, even if there's only one you use on a regular basis.
