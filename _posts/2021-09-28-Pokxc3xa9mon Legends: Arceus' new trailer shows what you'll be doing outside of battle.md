We already know that the upcoming Pokxc3xa9mon Legends: Arceus makes some big changes when it comes to combat and capturing monsters. But the latest trailer for the roleplaying game shows some of the other things you'll be doing. That includes familiar elements like riding pokxc3xa9mon, customizing your trainer with clothes and hairstyles, and what looks like a fairly robust photo mode. The trailer also ends with a look at a brand-new monster called Kleavor. Additionally, the developers revealed that players will get a device called an Arc Phone, which will likely serve as a pokxc3xa9dex of sorts. It also looks suspiciously like the titular new Arceus pokxc3xa9mon being introduced in the game.
