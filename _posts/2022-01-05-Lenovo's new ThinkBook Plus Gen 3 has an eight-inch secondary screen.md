Lenovo has announced the new ThinkBook Plus Gen 3, which has two (two!) screens. There's one 17.3-inch primary screen (like, the regular one), and there's another eight-inch screen on the keyboard deck. Various other models that have tried this form factor (namely, Asus' gaggle of Duo products) have put the secondary screen in the back of the deck and pushed the keyboard to the front. But Lenovo has instead put the keyboard on the right side of the chassis, smushing the keyboard to the left.
