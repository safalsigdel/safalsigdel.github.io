In September, CD Projekt Red said it was targeting late 2021 release dates for Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's next-gen upgrades, but on Wednesday, the company announced those won't be hitting this year. Now, the plan is for the next-gen version of Cyberpunk 2077 to release in the first quarter of 2022, while the next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is scheduled for a release in the second quarter of 2022.
