Most would agree that Sonos offers some of the best speakers and soundbars currently available. That's because Sonos makes speakers that — more often than not — boast great sound quality, support for all the major streaming platforms, and simple multi-room functionality. Unfortunately, however, those perks often come at a high price. Sonos products aren't cheap, and, outside of the occasional rogue discount, they rarely go on sale. However, that doesn't necessarily mean there aren't ways to save at least a few dollars on Sonos gear.
