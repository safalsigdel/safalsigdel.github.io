After a string of leaks, Ubisoft has officially unveiled the next major Assassin's Creed game. As expected, it's called Mirage and will shift the time-traveling series to 9th-century Baghdad, where players will take on the role of a budding assassin named Basim. (Fans might remember that name from an appearance in Assassin's Creed Valhalla; Mirage takes place two decades before that game.)
