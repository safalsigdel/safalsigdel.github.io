Google is releasing the second Android 13 developer preview on Thursday, and it includes a major new feature: apps will have to ask your permission to post notifications. iOS has had a similar feature for years, and it's a very useful way to make sure only certain apps send you notifications. I'm glad to see that Google plans to bring something like it to Android.
