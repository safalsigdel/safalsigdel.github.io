I am the very person who should care about my appearance on Zoom calls. I don't mean the state of my hair or appearance of hormonal acne on my face. I'm talking image quality. Focal length. Bokeh. I have written about and reviewed cameras and smartphones for over a decade. I use videoconferencing platforms throughout my work day. I own a nice camera that I could connect to my laptop and use for Zoom meetings. But I won't, and I simply do not care.
