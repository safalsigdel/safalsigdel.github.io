Google appears to be internally testing a second foldable Pixel smartphone, according to 9to5Google's sources. The device is said to be under development with the codename “Jumbojack,” that's referenced in a future version of Android 12 which 9to5Google identifies as “Android 12.1.” This is the latest foldable codename we've heard about at Google, following reports of another device called “Passport.”
