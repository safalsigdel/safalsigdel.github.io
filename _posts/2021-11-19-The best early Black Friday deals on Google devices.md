Google has launched its early Black Friday deals, and there's a lot to like if you're in the market for a Pixel, Chromecast, or Nest device. The search giant kicked off the deals in the Google Store, and now many of the big-name retailers are offering equivalent deals on the same items. Google even advertises these deals as running until December 1st, a few days after Cyber Monday.
