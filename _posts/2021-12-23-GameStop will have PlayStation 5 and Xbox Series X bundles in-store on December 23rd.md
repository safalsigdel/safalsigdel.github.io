Much like last week's in-person restock of the PlayStation 5, GameStop is once again hosting another day of in-store new console sales. This time, it will take place on Thursday, December 23rd, and include both the standard, disc drive-equipped PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X. This event is exclusive to GameStop Pro members, which costs $14.99 per year and can be purchased online in advance. GameStop has listed the participating stores for both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on its website, indicating that more locations are stocking Sony's console â€” 598 stores with PS5s Thursday, compared to 277 listed for Xbox.
