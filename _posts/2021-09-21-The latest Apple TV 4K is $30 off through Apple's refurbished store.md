If you've been waiting on a deal for the latest Apple TV, which has a faster processor and includes the new Siri remote, you can save $30 on it by buying refurbished through Apple itself via Slickdeals. The 32GB model costs $149 (was $179) and the 64GB model is $169 (was $199), but supplies are likely limited. While buying refurbished usually comes with a few words of caution, Apple's refurbished program ensures that products are in brand-new condition, with a full one-year manufacturer warranty. It even supports AppleCare, so you can extend the warranty if you'd like. Read our review.
