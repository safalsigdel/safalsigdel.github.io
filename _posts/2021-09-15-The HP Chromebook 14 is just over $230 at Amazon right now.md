The perfect laptop for the college-bound, this versatile 14-inch Chromebook from HP is available at Amazon for just $236, one of its better prices to date. This device packs a remarkable amount of versatility into a compact and lightweight package. At less than an inch thick and weighing in at less than 3.5 pounds, it's easy to tote around, without it turning into a third wheel. While the 13-hour battery may not provide all-day power, it's more than enough to ensure that it won't die on you during a crucial lecture.
