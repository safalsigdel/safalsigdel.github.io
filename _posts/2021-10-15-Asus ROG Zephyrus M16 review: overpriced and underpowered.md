I can't tell you how excited I was to test the Zephyrus M16. It takes the AMD-powered Zephyrus G15's exceptional chassis and adds the two things I most wish that laptop had: a 16:10 display and a webcam. That sounds like a great package on paper, but there's one other major thing that also differentiates the M16 from the G15: its Intel processor.
