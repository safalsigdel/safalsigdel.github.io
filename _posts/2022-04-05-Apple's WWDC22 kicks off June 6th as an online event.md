This year Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) will once again be an online-only event when it takes place from June 6th through June 10th. However, Apple said it will host an in-person session at Apple Park on June 6th, with some developers and students watching the keynote and State of the Union videos together, along with the online community. Details on how to apply for entry there will be available “soon.”
