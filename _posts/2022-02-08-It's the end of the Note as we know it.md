Samsung's first 2022 Galaxy Unpacked event hasn't started yet, but we've already got a strong notion that the event spells the end of the Note series. We know this because Samsung has done everything except shout from the rooftops that the next S-series Ultra will absorb the Note and its built-in stylus.

In any case, Samsung is making the right call for its business and its brand, even if it stings a little for the Note faithful.
