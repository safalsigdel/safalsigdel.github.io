Facebook and Instagram have instituted a temporary change in policy that allows users in some countries to post content that's usually forbidden, including calls for harm or even the death of Russian soldiers or politicians. The change first surfaced in a report by Reuters, citing internal emails to moderators. In them, the outlet reports mods are told that calls for the death of Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will be allowed, as long as they don't contain threats toward others or “indicators of credibility” like saying where or how the act will take place.
