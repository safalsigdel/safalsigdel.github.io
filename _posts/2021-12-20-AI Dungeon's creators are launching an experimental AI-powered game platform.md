Latitude, the startup behind text game AI Dungeon, is expanding into a new artificial intelligence-powered game platform called Voyage. The company announced the closed beta on Friday, opening a waitlist for current AI Dungeon users. It's the next step for a company that began with a university hackathon project, but that ultimately hopes to help other people create their own games using trained AI models.
