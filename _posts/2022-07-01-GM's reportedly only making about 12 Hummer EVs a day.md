Months after General Motors started delivering its first Hummer EVs, the company is reportedly only producing around 12 of the massive electric trucks a day, according to The Wall Street Journal. That's an abysmally slow pace, even compared to how many electric trucks other automakers are making: the Journal says Ford's producing around 150 F-150 Lightings a day, whereas Rivian's Q1 production numbers indicate it's making somewhere between 30 and 40 EVs a day (Rivian didn't immediately respond to The Verge's request for more specific numbers).
