How small can a soundbar get while still offering Dolby Atmos? According to Polk, the answer is 14.5 inches. That's the width of the company's new $499 MagniFi Mini AX, which supports both Atmos and DTS:X. In addition to the very compact soundbar, Polk is also including a wireless subwoofer for that price.
