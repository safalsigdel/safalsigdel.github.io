Despite feeling uncannily similar to play as past installments, Splatoon 3 is packed with smart changes and updates that will likely lead to people — or at least, me — keeping the game in rotation for much longer than before. I got to play over an hour of the game's various modes ahead of its September 9th launch, including just a few levels of the main story, a few rounds of Salmon Run (the game's surprisingly difficult but rewarding horde mode), and Turf War (Splatoon's take on a four-versus-four deathmatch).
