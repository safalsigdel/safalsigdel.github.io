Playing games on the new Xbox app made for TVs feels like a big deal. There's no console and no hidden HDMI streaming device. Yet, in my brief hands-on demo, games like Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 loaded quickly and — most importantly — they played well with both Xbox and PlayStation 5 wireless controllers. And if you aren't a Game Pass subscriber, you'll still be able to jump into Fortnite immediately through the app for free after you sign in with a Microsoft account.
