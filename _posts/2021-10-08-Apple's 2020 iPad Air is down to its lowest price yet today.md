Apple's fourth-generation iPad Air with a refreshed design and USB-C charging instead of Lightning is down to its best price yet at Amazon. You can get the 64GB Wi-Fi model in the color of your choosing for $489 â€” $10 less than the starting price for the new iPad Mini that has a similar design. For the price, you're getting a far bigger tablet. If you've been in the market for a high-end iPad but don't want to put down iPad Pro-levels of cash, this could be exactly what you're after.
