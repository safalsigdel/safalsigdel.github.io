No matter what time of year it lands, Amazon Prime Day is always one of the best opportunities to buy Amazon's own products. Now that Prime Day 2022 is upon us, last year's excellent Kindle Paperwhite is selling for a new all-time low of $94.99. This is $45 below the usual starting price for the ad-supported model. If you're in the market for a Kindle, this is maybe just the ideal model to get, and the perfect price to buy it for. Unless, of course, you prefer the ad-free version — which is discounted by $50 to $109.99.
