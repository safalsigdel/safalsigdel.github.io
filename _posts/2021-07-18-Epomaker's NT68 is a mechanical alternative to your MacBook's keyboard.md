If you can't stand to type on a Macbook's scissor switch keyboard, let alone a butterfly model, and you don't fancy lugging around one of the small number of laptops with a full-on mechanical keyboard built in, then Epomaker's new wireless keyboard might be one for you. The NT68 is designed to sit on top of a MacBook or other laptop's existing keyboard so your fingers don't have to put up with their rubbery key switches for a single second longer than they need to.
