Updated 10:30AM ET, November 23rd: In case you haven't already plopped down cash on one of these bundles, Amazon's promo is the best we've seen yet. It includes the 128GB headset, the $49 zip-up case and a $50 Amazon credit for $299.99. That's $100 in savings, making it the easy choice if you're trying to get the most bang for your buck.
