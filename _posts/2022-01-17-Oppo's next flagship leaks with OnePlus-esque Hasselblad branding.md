Details on Oppo's upcoming flagship phone are starting to come together. Multiple leaks are suggesting it'll be called the Find X5 Pro, with a similar design to last year's Find X3 Pro and specs broadly in line with the new OnePlus 10 Pro, which is already available in China. (OnePlus, of course, is now treated as a sub-brand of Oppo.)
