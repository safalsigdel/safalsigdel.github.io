Today, the Supreme Court effectively overturned the right to a legal abortion established by Roe v. Wade in 1973. In a 6-3 ruling, the court voted to reverse a lower court's decision in the case of Dobbs v.

More significantly, the ruling removed any constitutional restriction on laws banning abortion procedures.
