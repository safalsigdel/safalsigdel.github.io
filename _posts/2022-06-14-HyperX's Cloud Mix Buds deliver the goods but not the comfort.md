HyperX has distilled some of its gaming headset know-how into a much more portable form factor: a set of wireless earbuds called the Cloud Mix Buds. These $149.99 earbuds largely replicate the standard features of over-ear gaming headphones, at least in terms of connectivity. They include a 2.4GHz USB-C transmitter that lets them pair to a PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, or an Android phone. They can also be paired to your phone or another device via Bluetooth.
