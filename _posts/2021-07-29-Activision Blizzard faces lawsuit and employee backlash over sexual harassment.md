Female employees of Activision Blizzard faced “constant sexual harassment” and discrimination based on their gender, according to a lawsuit filed against the company by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. Some of the claims in the suit are disturbing enough to require a content warning. Activision Blizzard's initial official response called the state's descriptions “distorted, and in many cases false,” though one of Blizzard's executives has called them “extremely troubling” and Activision Blizzard's CEO later called the company's first response “tone deaf.”
