Google has revealed an in-progress design for the Play Store's upcoming safety section, which will provide information about an app's data collection, privacy, and security practices. Announced in May, developers will be able to start declaring their safety info in October until a deadline of April next year. The safety section is currently due to start appearing in app descriptions in the first quarter of 2022.
