If you'd prefer a more affordable console to the Xbox Series X — or one that's more readily available than the PlayStation 5 and PS5 Digital Edition — you can once again buy Microsoft's Xbox Series S at its lowest price to date. Regularly $299.99, Adorama is currently selling the entry-level Xbox for $249.99 when you use the promo code XBOXS2250 at checkout.
