Many websites — including banking pages, brokerages, and gaming services — were affected for just over an hour Thursday, as part of a major internet outage. During the outage, consumers were unable to access services like Ally Bank, Fidelity, Sony's PlayStation Network, Airbnb, and more. Several airline sites were also affected: Delta, British Airways, and Southwest's sites were either down, or had important functionality like flight check-ins broken.
