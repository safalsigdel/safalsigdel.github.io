Twitter is holding a competition in hopes that hackers and researchers will be able to identify biases in its image cropping algorithm â€” and it's going to be handing out cash prizes to winning teams (via Engadget). Twitter is hoping that giving teams access to its code and image cropping model will let them find ways that the algorithm could be harmful (such as it cropping in a way that stereotypes or erases the image's subject).
