Facebook is announcing a new, “more social” home space for Oculus users. Called Horizon Home, it looks a lot like the virtual home that people already have in their virtual reality headsets. But users will be able to invite friends to hang out and watch videos or start multiplayer games together, and they'll eventually be able to customize their space, although that's “a little further out.” Horizon Home will launch in an Oculus update soon.
