Brydge's latest keyboard case for the Surface Pro 8 is a little different than the company's previous versions. The $229 SP Max Plus consists of a rugged, backlit keyboard and a rugged, detachable case for Microsoft's current-gen Surface tablet â€” all of which have an antimicrobial coating. Notably, it operates with a physical connection, not a wireless one. Getting connected via Bluetooth isn't (usually) that finicky, but you won't have to worry about that at all here.
