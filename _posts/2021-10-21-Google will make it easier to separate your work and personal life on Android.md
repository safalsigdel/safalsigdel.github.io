Google's Work Profile tool for Android, which lets you hide your work apps and data with the flip of a switch and keeps your personal phone use safe from your company, will be coming to more users next year. According to a blog post from the company, currently, the feature is limited to phones that your organization manages, but Google says it'll start to become available to people using Google Workspace in 2022. After that, it'll branch out with the ultimate goal of letting anyone using Android for work flip a switch to make their business apps disappear.
