Mel Martinez's dad had an unusual (and very much unofficial) title in the Air Force: stitch bitch. Decades later, that title — given to the many men whose duties included sewing — has now become something of a rallying cry for queer sewists like Martinez, who put gender affirmation at the center of their creations. Martinez and many others are updating their craft to subvert status quo designs that don't quite fit, building, instead, a world of underwear, lingerie, and intimates in which everybody (and body) is welcome.
