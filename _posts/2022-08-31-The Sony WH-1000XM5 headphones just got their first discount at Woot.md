Our Tuesday deals begin with the first substantial discount we've seen on the Sony WH-1000XM5 noise-canceling headphones. The original price for the XM5 headphones was $399.99, but Woot has discounted them to just $339.99. If you're okay with settling for Woot's 90-day limited warranty instead of the one-year warranty offered by Sony, this is definitely a deal worth looking into. While the XM5 headphones don't offer any sweeping changes over the previous iteration, the XM4, they still include some of the best noise cancelation capabilities you'll find in a pair of headphones, in addition to improved sound quality and better performance on voice calls. Read our review.
