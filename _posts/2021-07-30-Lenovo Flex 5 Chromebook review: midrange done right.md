Currently available for less than $400, the Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook is a pretty dang good deal. You get Intel's capable 10th Gen processors, a sturdy and nice-looking chassis, a touchscreen with stylus support, a comfortable backlit keyboard, and a satisfactory port selection. While there's no standout feature to enthusiastically praise, there's not too much to complain about. That's enough, of course, to make the Flex 5 one of the best midrange Chromebooks you can buy â€” as long as you're aware of the tradeoffs you're making for the price.
