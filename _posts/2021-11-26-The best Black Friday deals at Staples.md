Staples has launched its Black Friday sales and is discounting a diverse range of items. While some are naturally very specific to office work  — the retailer is currently offering up to 60 percent printer paper, for example — there are also some solid deals on smart displays, earbuds, and other tech products, many of which can also be found in our detailed guide to the best Black Friday deals. To help you take advantage of the best deals before they sell out, however, we've curated a list of some of the top discounts Staples is currently offering, from the HomePod mini to Amazon's Fire TV Stick 4K.
