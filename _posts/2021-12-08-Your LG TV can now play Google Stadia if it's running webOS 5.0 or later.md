Have a gamepad handy and a recent LG TV? You can likely now try Google's Stadia cloud gaming platform â€” as of today, it's an app you can download for your television running webOS 5.0 or webOS 6.0 (read: likely 2020 models or later) in any of the 22 countries that Google covers. You'll find it in the LG app store on your TV.
