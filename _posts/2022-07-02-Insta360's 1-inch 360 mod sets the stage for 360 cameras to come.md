In 2020, Insta360 began betting big on modular cameras. Instead of replacing its entire system with each product cycle, the company started making cameras that allowed owners to upgrade a single part of the camera they already have. So even though Insta360's latest camera, the One RS 1-inch 360 Edition, looks wildly different than its predecessor, the One RS, it is built on the same processor and software Insta360 customers already own and know. It's an incredibly smart approach, but it relies heavily on each modification significantly improving the experience in some way.
