Apple just announced the ninth-gen entry-level iPad on Tuesday at the iPhone 13 event and began taking orders, with availability opening up on September 24th. But now, Walmart is offering a nice discount on preorders of its own. You can preorder the new base model 2021 iPad with a $30 discount, bringing the price down to just $299 for the 64GB Wi-Fi configuration. It will ship a little bit later than if purchased through Apple, around September 29th, but it's rare get a 10 percent discount on a brand-new product if you're willing to wait just a few more days.
