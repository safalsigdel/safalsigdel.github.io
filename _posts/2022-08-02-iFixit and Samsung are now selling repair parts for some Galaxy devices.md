Samsung and Fixit have launched their repair program that lets Galaxy S20, S21, and Tab S7 Plus owners buy replacement parts for their devices and access guides on how to do DIY fixes. The program still has most of the caveats that my colleague Umar Shakir pointed out when it was announced in March — it's not launching with parts for Samsung's latest flagship devices and there's a limited number of repairs you can do — but it's good to see that at least some Galaxy owners will now be able to do their own repairs at home. Samsung also says it's planning to expand the devices and types of repairs that are covered in the future.
