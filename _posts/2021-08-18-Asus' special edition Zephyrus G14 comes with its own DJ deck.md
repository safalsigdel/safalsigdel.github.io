If there's one company I trust to do a good job with utterly ridiculous computer ideas, it's Asus. Last fall, the company worked with cyberpunky fashion designer Acronym to make possibly the weirdest-looking gaming laptop I've ever seen (the ZPHYRS G14 ACRNM). This year, it's partnered with popular DJ Alan Walker to create a less avant-garde, more musical version of the same device. This is the Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition, a laptop for gamers, DJs, and (ideally) gamer DJs.
