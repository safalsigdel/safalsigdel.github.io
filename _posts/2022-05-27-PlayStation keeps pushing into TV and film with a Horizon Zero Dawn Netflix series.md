Sony is continuing to go all in on turning its flagship video games into TV shows and movies — according to Variety, the company announced that it's making a show based on Horizon Zero Dawn with Netflix at an event for investors. Sony is also working on a movie based on the Gran Turismo series, according to Deadline, but hasn't found a distributor for it yet, and could feature Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Chappie) as its director. (I'm very curious as to what the plan for this series is — Variety just says it'll be about “racing.”)
