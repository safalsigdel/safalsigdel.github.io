Acer is adding a Chromebook to its Vero lineup, which it says is meant to offer laptop buyers an “eco-conscious” option. Like the (rather disappointing) Windows laptop that came before it, the Chromebook Vero 514 is made using recycled plastics, has a chassis that's 99 percent recyclable, and comes in packaging that's 90 percent recycled paper, according to the company. Acer's press release even suggests that part of the Chromebook's packaging can be “transformed into a multi-purpose triangular laptop stand,” if you're loathe to throw anything away.
