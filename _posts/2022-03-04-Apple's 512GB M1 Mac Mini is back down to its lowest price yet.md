There have been rumors of a new, higher-end Mac Mini swirling for a while now. And with Apple's upcoming March 8th event, we'll find out one way or another soon. In the meantime, the current M1 Mac Mini with 512GB of storage costs $749.99 at Amazon. The discounted price (totaling about $149 off its original cost) is reflected at checkout. This model comes with 512GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, and it matches its all-time low price that was last seen during Cyber Monday.
