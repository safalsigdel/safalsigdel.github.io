TikTokers have demonstrated that Disney's text-to-speech TikTok voice, meant to sound like Rocket the Raccoon, would refuse to read words like “gay,” “lesbian,” or “queer” out loud. This decision seems to have been reverted — you can now get the voice to read out those words, but it's unclear why it was happening. The change, however, is very recent — The Verge confirmed that the voice wouldn't say the words, but it started to do so in a subsequent test minutes later on Monday afternoon. TikTok hasn't commented on why this happened, but videos posted to highlight the issue still have the words blanked out.
