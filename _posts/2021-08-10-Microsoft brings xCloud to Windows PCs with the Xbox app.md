Microsoft is bringing xCloud to Windows PCs through its Xbox app today. Xbox Insiders will be able to access a new updated Xbox app with Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) built in. Much like how xCloud works through the web, you'll just need a compatible controller connected via Bluetooth or USB to access Xbox games from a Windows 10 PC.
