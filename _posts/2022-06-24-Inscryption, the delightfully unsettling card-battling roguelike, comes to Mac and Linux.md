One of the best games of last year, Inscryption, has been released on Mac and Linux after previously being exclusively available for Windows PCs, its director Daniel Mullins has announced. Inscryption is a deck-building card-battling roguelike but with a fantastically dark and mysterious metanarrative that elevates it from “interesting” to “utterly engrossing.” Both my colleague Ash Parrish as well as our friends over at Polygon picked it as their game of the year for 2021.
