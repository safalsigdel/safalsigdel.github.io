Google says that an alpha version of Steam is finally available for Chrome OS users with specific machines to test, as long as they're willing to put a beta OS on their computer. This announcement comes after the company prematurely said Valve's PC game store was available last week before changing its tune to say it would be “coming soon.” While Google's John Maletis, a Chrome OS VP, calls it “early days” for the software, it's exciting that we're finally going to get a peek at what the Steam experience will be like on Chromebooks.
