Motorola is today announcing its latest smartphone for the US market. And while I wish it were the sleek new 2022 Razr — currently only available in China — we're instead looking at another entry in the company's Edge lineup. The Edge phones are designed to offer several flagship-tier features at an accessible price point. (Motorola's Edge Plus, meanwhile, directly competes in the premium, more expensive bracket.)
