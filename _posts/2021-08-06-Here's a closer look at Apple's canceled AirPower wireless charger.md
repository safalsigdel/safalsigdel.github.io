Apple's AirPower wireless charger was supposed to arrive with the unique ability to charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all at the same time. Unfortunately, Apple canceled AirPower in March 2019, citing difficulties in bringing the product to life. Since then, we've seen a teardown of AirPower, some AirPower clones, and Apple's MagSafe battery packs. Now, an Apple prototype collector has obtained a working AirPower unit for the first time.
