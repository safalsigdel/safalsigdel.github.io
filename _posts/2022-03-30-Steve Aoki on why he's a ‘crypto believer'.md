I have always been utterly fascinated by the constant back and forth between tech and the music business â€” new tech makes it easy to create and distribute music, but every time that happens, the business model of music changes. And my pet theory is that whatever is happening to music today is a preview of what will happen to everything else five years from now. Take streaming: Spotify came to the US in 2011, years before Netflix released House of Cards, and now Apple TV Plus just had a movie that won the Oscar for Best Picture.
