You shouldn't be concerned about the delay of Matter, the new smart home interoperability standard, because we're not. That's the message from smart home device makers Eve Systems and Nanoleaf, who have been involved with developing the protocol that promises smart home nirvana since its earliest days. “I think the three-month delay might actually be a good thing,” says Gimmy Chu CEO of Nanoleaf. “I feel that now there's more certainty across the industry that we'll have unity at time of launch.”
