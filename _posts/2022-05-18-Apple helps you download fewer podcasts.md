Confession: I have stopped automatic downloads on Apple Podcasts because I am reckless with my data and have absolutely let podcast downloads eat my phone on more than one occasion. I love having back episodes of Stuff You Missed in History Class for the subway as much as the next guy, but I also need to be able to save and send my husband I Think You Should Leave GIFs at will (xe2x99xab it's the little things you do together xe2x99xab). Anyway, point being, Apple's new update that lets users limit downloads to five episodes at a time feels like it was tailor-made for me.
