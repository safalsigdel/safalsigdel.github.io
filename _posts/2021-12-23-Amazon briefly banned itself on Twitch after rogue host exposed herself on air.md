In a weird internet mix-up, it looks like Amazon briefly suspended its Spanish-language Prime Video Twitch channel on Sunday after a host exposed herself on-air, according to a report from the BBC. The ban was lifted after less than 24 hours, according to Android Police, and the broadcast appears to have been deleted from the channel. But it's a bit unusual for Amazon to essentially ban itself; the e-comm giant has owned Twitch since 2014.
