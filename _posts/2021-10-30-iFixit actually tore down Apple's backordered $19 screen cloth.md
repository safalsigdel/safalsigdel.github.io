I can't say I expected there to be more news about Apple's $19 Screen Polishing cloth, but here we are. Not only has iFixit given it the teardown treatment and a (perhaps slightly tongue-in-cheek) repair score, but it's apparently become one of Apple's hardest-to-get products. And yes, to reiterate, we are still talking about a cloth made to clean your devices' screens.
