T-Mobile is pushing some new app features focused on getting prospective customers to switch with as little friction as possible, all thanks to eSIM technology. There's a new version of the existing Test Drive program called Network Pass, which allows people to try out T-Mobile's network with unlimited data for three months. Another new feature called Easy Switch aims to streamline the process of setting up a new account with T-Mobile using eSIM. They're all part of an update to the company's app coming to iOS today, with an Android update to follow “soon.”
