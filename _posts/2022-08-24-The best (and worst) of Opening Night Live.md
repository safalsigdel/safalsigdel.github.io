To kick off Gamescom this week, Geoff Keighley hosted his Opening Night Live event, a two hour-long gauntlet featuring announcements and trailers of video games, including many that aren't made in the US. Here's a not-at-all-exhaustive list of some of the most interesting games â€” if you want that, check out the full video here. We also covered some of the biggest news from the show in other articles, including Hideo Kojima's new Spotify podcast, the release date of Return to Monkey Island, Sony's new Edge controller, and even a Pokxc3xa9mon concept car.
