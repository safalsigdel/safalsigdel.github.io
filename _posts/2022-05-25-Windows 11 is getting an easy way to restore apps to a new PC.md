Microsoft is finally adding restore apps to the Microsoft Store on Windows 11. The software maker will soon start testing a new feature that allows you to restore apps onto a new Windows 11 PC. The existing Microsoft Store hasn't offered an automatic way to restore apps, instead forcing Windows users to manually install apps from their library.
