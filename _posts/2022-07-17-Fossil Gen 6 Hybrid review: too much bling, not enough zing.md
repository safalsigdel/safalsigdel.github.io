The first time I saw Fossil's hybrid analog smartwatches was in a backroom at IFA 2019. I'd just seen a small army of smartwatches from Fossil â€” and every other designer brand under its umbrella. I remember feeling weary. Most of those watches were basically different flavors of the same smartwatch. But when a spokesperson showed me the Fossil Hybrid HR, I perked up. A hybrid smartwatch with an E Ink display? That was a rare sight after Pebble's untimely end, and I was intrigued to see what it could do. Three years later, I've got the $229 Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid ($249 as tested), and while it's kept the same DNA as the original, I can't help but feel that Fossil's gotten ahead of itself.
