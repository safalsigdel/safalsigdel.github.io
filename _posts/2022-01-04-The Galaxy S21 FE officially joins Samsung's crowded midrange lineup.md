After a year of will-they-or-won't-they speculation, Samsung has, at last, announced the Galaxy S21 FE. Like the 2020 Galaxy S20 FE (the FE stands for Fan Edition), this device features most of the flagship-level specs of the Galaxy S21, including a Snapdragon 888 chipset and 120Hz display, at a lower price: $699 for the 128GB base model. With the S21's nearly midrange price tag and a compelling upper-midrange option in the Galaxy A52 5G, it's yet another addition to an already crowded spot in Samsung's lineup.
