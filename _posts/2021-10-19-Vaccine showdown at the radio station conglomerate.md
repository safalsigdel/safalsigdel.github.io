Happy Tuesday, y'all. Welcome to the week. As I mentioned in my Thursday Hot Pod Insider, I saw Dune on Friday â€” loved it. I didn't know this movie was only part one of two, though! Unfair! Anyway, the podcast news is trickling out this week, and by trickle, I truly mean a drop or two for us to savor, so today's a fairly short one. Insiders will get more on Thursday and Friday. Reminder that if you want to keep up with all the audio news fit for a newsletter, you can subscribe here. I'm sure your boss will be happy to expense it.
