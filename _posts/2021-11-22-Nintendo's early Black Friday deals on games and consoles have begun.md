Nintendo's early Black Friday deals kicked off on Sunday, November 21st, and they'll last until November 27th. Like last year, the main attraction is the standard Nintendo Switch console that includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and a three-month individual membership to Nintendo Switch Online. It all costs $299.99. Nintendo confirmed that the Switch console included here is the V2 model with improved battery life. Altogether, these items would cost around $370, so the $299 price point is stellar.
