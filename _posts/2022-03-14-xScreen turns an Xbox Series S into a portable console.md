If you've ever owned a screen for the PSone or the GameCube, the xScreen will look instantly familiar. The xScreen is an 11.6-inch (1080p) display that attaches to the rear of an Xbox Series S, and it transforms Microsoft's miniature console into more of an Xbox laptop for on-the-go gaming. It's a modern take on the tiny 5-inch cramped LCD displays we've seen attached to consoles in the past, and it's a great accessory if you never want to worry about attaching an Xbox to a TV when you're traveling.
