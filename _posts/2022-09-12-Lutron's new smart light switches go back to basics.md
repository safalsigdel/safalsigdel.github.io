Lutron Casxc3xa9ta has added two new smart switches to its lineup. The switches are modeled on its existing non-smart “Diva” paddle switch style, giving its distinctive smart switch line a more traditional look. Lutron Casxc3xa9ta is probably one of the most reliable DIY smart lighting systems available today; it uses a proprietary protocol powered by Lutron's smart hub rather than Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
