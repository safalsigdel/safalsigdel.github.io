Block Party, the anti-harassment service that specializes in making Twitter more tolerable to use, is out of beta and available now. Block Party automates the time-consuming process of moderating your Twitter feed, filtering out content from people you don't want to see for later review and, starting today, blocking accounts that retweet or like a bad tweet of your choice with blocklists.
