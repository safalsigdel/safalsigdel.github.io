Sony is setting some pretty grand expectations with its 2022 TV lineup â€” led by the introduction of the world's first consumer QD-OLED TV. The company's current and well-regarded OLED sets use panels from LG Display that are tuned with Sony's own processing. But the new flagship Bravia XR A95K TV will include a QD-OLED (quantum dot organic light emitting diode) panel manufactured by none other than Samsung Display. It'll come in 65-inch and 55-inch sizes, with both coming in at 4K resolution.
