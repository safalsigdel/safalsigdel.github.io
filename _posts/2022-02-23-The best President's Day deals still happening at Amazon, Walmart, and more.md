President's Day may have come and gone, but there are still plenty of deals still going on now for you to take advantage of. This USA federal holiday is an interesting one: it was originally established to celebrate the birthday of George Washington, but the passage of time transformed it into a day when we distract ourselves from the foibles of our democratically elected leadership by treating ourselves to some of the best deals of the year. It starts a little early, runs through the weekend, and now some deals continue on.
