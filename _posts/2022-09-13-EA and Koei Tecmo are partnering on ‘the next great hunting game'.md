EA and Koei Tecmo are partnering on a new title that they're describing as “the next great hunting game.” When I first read that description, my thoughts jumped to Big Buck Hunter, the arcade series of hunting games where you shoot wild animals, but looking at the concept art (above), combined with who's making it, I'm guessing this game will actually be much more like Capcom's popular Monster Hunter series.
