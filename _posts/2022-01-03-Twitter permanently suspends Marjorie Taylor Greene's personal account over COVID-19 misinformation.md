Twitter has permanently suspended Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene's personal account for repeatedly violating the platform's rules on COVID-19 misinformation, as noted in a report by CNN. Since the ban only affects Greene's personal Twitter account, @mtgreenee, she can still access and tweet from her governmental account, @RepMTG.
