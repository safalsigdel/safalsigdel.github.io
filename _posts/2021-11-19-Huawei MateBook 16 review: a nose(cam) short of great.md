Huawei laptops haven't been widely available in the US for years. But they've traditionally been fantastic products, with good enough performance and build quality to make them serious MacBook competitors. So I figured I'd review the MateBook 16, Huawei's latest flagship notebook, even though it may not be on the radars of our US readers. Consider this a resource for those in markets where Huawei is still operating but also a quick check on what the rest of us are missing out on.
