The co-hosts of The Nod are back, and this time, they've separated from Gimlet Media and Spotify and are instead taking their work to SiriusXM's Stitcher. Brittany Luse and Eric Eddings tell The Verge today that they're relaunching their Black culture show For Colored Nerds this fall, which they created, hosted, and produced prior to working at Gimlet. The podcast will be available widely and isn't exclusive to one platform.
