With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, finding a deal on an M1-equipped MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult. It's a slightly different story for the MacBook Pros with the beefier M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs, but any bit of savings you can get on the new Pro models is sure to be worthwhile. As for the new 13-inch MacBook Pro and MacBook Air with M2, it may still take a while to see some deals.
