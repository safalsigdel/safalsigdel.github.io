If you're the kind of gamer who won't rest until every last component is equipped with RGB lighting, right down to the case fans in their PC, then do I have a smartphone for you. Nubia has just launched its RedMagic 7S Pro gaming smartphone internationally and, much like last year's RedMagic 6S Pro, some models feature transparent backplates to let you see their internal RGB-equipped fans. These fans aren't just for show, and can spin at up to 20,000rpm to keep the phone's internals cool as part of what Nubia calls a “ten-layer multi-dimensional cooling system.”
