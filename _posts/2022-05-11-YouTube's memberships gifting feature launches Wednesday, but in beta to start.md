YouTube is launching gifted memberships in beta, and they'll be available for select channels beginning Wednesday. Memberships are YouTube's take on Twitch's subscriptions, which viewers can use to show financial support for creators and get access to certain perks like custom emoji. Twitch users have been able to buy gift subscriptions for some time, but if you've wanted to buy gift memberships to other fans of a YouTube channel, you haven't been able to.
