Google is rolling out its February update for Pixel phones running Android 12, which is meant to fix a few camera, Bluetooth, and keyboard issues. The company says that some users will start getting the update today and that the “rollout will continue over the next week in phases depending on carrier and device.” Google's previous update process was a bit of a fiasco for Pixel 6 owners, so hopefully, this one ends up being more routine.
