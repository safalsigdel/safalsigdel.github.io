Scrolling through your Xbox game library, it can be difficult to tell which games you can actually play at the moment â€” perhaps you downloaded something from Game Pass, but it's no longer on the service, or your friend came over to play a game and took the disc it was on home with them. Microsoft is currently testing a solution to this problem, with badges that will warn you that a game can't be launched, according to Xbox engineering lead Eden Marie.
