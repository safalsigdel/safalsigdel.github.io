Although many data plans these days are advertised as “unlimited,” most actually have a cut-off point when your data stream is going to slow radically. If you don't want to pay the premium prices that “unlimited” plans demand, then it's even more important that you avoid going beyond your maximum data allowance, or there will be high penalties to pay. Either way, it's smart to monitor your data flow — not only to make sure you don't pass your limits but also to find out if you need to rethink your current data plan.
