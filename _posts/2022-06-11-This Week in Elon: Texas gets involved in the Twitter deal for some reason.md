So, noted shitposter Elon Musk wants out of his Twitter deal, and he's gotten his lawyers to write a lil letter to Twitter about it. According to the letter, Twitter is a bunch of big meanies that aren't giving Musk the information he needs to close the transaction, specifically about bots and spam. According to the letter, this is very important for Twitter's business model. There was a time to have this conversation, and it was during due diligence, which Musk waived. I'm very unsympathetic to both Musk and his lawyers here.
