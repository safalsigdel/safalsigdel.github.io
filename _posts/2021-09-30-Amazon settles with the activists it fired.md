Amazon has settled a dispute with two workers that the National Labor Relations Board said were fired for their activism. In April 2020, the company fired Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa after they had organized a protest against Amazon's work with oil and gas companies, as well as raising concerns with the company's coronavirus measures at its warehouses. In a joint statement, Costa and Cunningham said that the company would have to pay them lost wages as well as inform employees that they couldn't be fired for organizing. They haven't mentioned whether they would be getting their jobs as UX designers back.
