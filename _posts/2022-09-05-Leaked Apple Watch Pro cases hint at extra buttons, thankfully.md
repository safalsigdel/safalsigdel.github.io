Images of purported third-party accessories for the rumored Apple Watch Pro are making the rounds this morning, and boy do I hope they're legit. Those cutouts mean one or two more physical buttons are being added to the left of the display, while keeping space for the existing digital crown and side button to the right. If true, it means that Apple really understands the multisport athletes this watch is supposedly targeting. Adventure junkies like touchscreens for some things, but need to have big grabby buttons when in the surf, under water, on the slopes, and bombing down trails.
