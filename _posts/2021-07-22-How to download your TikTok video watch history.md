I have a very bad habit of accidentally touching my phone's screen, which often results in going a page forward or back in the book I'm reading or leaving the YouTube video I'm watching â€” or going to a different TikTok video than the one I was just enjoying. In addition, if I have to take a phone call or answer a Slack message, I can lose track of where I was.
