GoPro is announcing a new accessory for its action cameras that's a jack of all trades â€” the Volta acts as a grippable handle / tripod, a wired or wireless remote, and has a 4,900mAh battery that the company says can triple your camera's battery life, providing four hours of record time when paired with a completely charged internal battery if you're shooting 5.3K footage.
