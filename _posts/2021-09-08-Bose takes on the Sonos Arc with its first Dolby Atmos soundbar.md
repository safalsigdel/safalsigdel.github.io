Fresh off the announcement of its QuietComfort 45 headphones last week, Bose is shifting some attention to its home theater business. Today, the company introduced its latest flagship soundbar, the $899.95 Smart Soundbar 900. With features like Dolby Atmos — a first for Bose soundbars — HDMI eARC, multi-room Wi-Fi music playback, AirPlay 2, and support for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, Bose's latest soundbar seems very much intended to compete with the Sonos Arc. (It also allows for streaming audio over Bluetooth, which the Sonos does not.) It'll be available starting September 23rd, with preorders beginning now.
