Developers, historically, have had somewhat limited options when it comes to testing apps for Windows on Arm. They've commonly needed to purchase costly Arm devices like the Surface Pro X, which starts at $899.99. Microsoft and Qualcomm aim to lower that barrier to entry with the new ECS Liva Mini Box QC710 Desktop, a tiny Snapdragon-based PC that's now available for $219 on the Microsoft Store.
