All kinds of stuff are on sale when Amazon Prime Day lasts two whole days. Here are some things we love, some of our favorites, and even some utter crap. But one intriguing piece of tech that's currently on a Lightning Deal is the Chipofy 6.6-foot USB-C 100W charging cable, complete with a freakin' built-in display for power metering. This nifty little tool is on sale for just $15.32, a savings of $10.67 (41 percent) off its regular $25.99 asking price. It outputs enough wattage to power and charge even some full-size laptops, but the best part is you'll know exactly how many watts are actually reaching your device.
