Facebook's almighty News Feed is getting split in twoxe2x80xa6 kind of. Today, it's announcing two feeds that will now be found in its iOS and Android apps. Home is the new name for the tab you see when you first open the app and is designed for discovery with Reels, Stories, and other personalized content.
