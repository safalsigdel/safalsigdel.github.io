If you're a savvy tech shopper, you can set your watch to the annual cadence of TV deals. There are the big ones, like Black Friday and the Super Bowl, and then smatterings around and in-between with Memorial Day, Labor Day, and some others. Amazon Prime Day has become another notable TV shopping holiday, with its somewhat annual cadence and occasional date changes starting back in 2015. With Prime Day 2022 kicking off, it's another great chance to get a new 4K TV or upgrade your existing one for something better, faster, and maybe even bigger.
