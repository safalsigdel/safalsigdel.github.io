Not content with cornering the market with its USB microphones, the latest product from Logitech-owned Blue is a detachable mic called the Icepop. It's a $49.99 upgrade that can replace the default mics included with Logitech's G Pro X Wireless gaming headset, the G Pro X, the G Pro, as well as Astro's A40 headsets.
