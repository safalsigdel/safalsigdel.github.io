A set of noise-canceling headphones should definitely come in handy if you're planning to travel soon. They're essential if you want to silence the hum of the jet engines or to hush distracting sounds that are keeping you from concentrating. If you're interested in a good set that won't cost you too much, the Bose QuietComfort 35 II headphones are $169 off their original price at Target and Amazon. These retailers are selling the QC35 II for just $179.99 instead of $349, although note your order will most likely not arrive by Christmas.
