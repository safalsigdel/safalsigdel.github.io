Just like the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3s I recently reviewed, Beyerdynamic's new Free Byrd earbuds are squarely aimed at those who prioritize sound quality over almost everything else. When you consider that these are the company's first-ever set of true wireless earbuds, I've been pleasantly surprised at how well they also stand out in other respects: the $249 Free Byrds deliver marathon battery life, good active noise cancellation, and have a design that breaks from the standard, unmemorable formula.
