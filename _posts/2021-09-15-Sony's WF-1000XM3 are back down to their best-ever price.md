Best Buy and Amazon are hosting a deal on Sony's WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds that offer stellar sound quality and active noise cancellation. Originally $229, they're available from Amazon in the black or silver colorways for $148. Best Buy has them for $150. This model includes a USB-C charging case and multiple sets of ear tips to help you find a perfect fit. The XM3s have been outclassed by Sony's own XM4 that released in June 2021, but this older model is still a great value. We called the XM3 “the best AirPods rival” at the time of release, citing their lengthy battery life, effective noise cancellation, and seriously good sound quality. Given that their price has dropped sharply (and that the XM4 cost a staggering $278), it's an especially great time to consider buying these. Read our review.
