If you're shopping for the best cheap laptop of 2021, the question to ask is: what's most important, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Even the best cheap laptops aren't perfect in every area â€” they have some strengths but cut corners to achieve their price tags. You can almost certainly find a budget laptop with a touchscreen, a premium-looking chassis, an HDMI port, a backlit keyboard, or stylus support, but you may need to consider which of those features you want the most, and which you can go without.
