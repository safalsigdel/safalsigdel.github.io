Google's testing a darker dark mode for its Android search app (via Android Police), according to 9to5Google. This new shade still isn't the same as the one presented in Google's test of a pitch-black dark mode on desktops last month. Rather, the one spotted in the mobile app is darker than the usual dark gray but still lighter than pitch black. I momentarily had the pitch-black search page on desktop, but shortly after, it switched back to dark gray.
