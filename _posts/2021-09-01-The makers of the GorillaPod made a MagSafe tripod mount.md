Joby has released a MagSafe mount for tripods that should simplify the process of attaching an iPhone 12 and any future iPhone models that support MagSafe. The new GripTight mount allows for quick attachment, letting the mount hold on to your phone either by just its MagSafe magnet or with a more secure option that tightly grips the edges of your phone like Joby's previous smartphone mounts. With the latter use case, people may not know that you're partially connected to the GripTight mount with MagSafe, but at least you'll know it in your heart.
