Nothing, the consumer tech startup led by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, has shown off the rear design of its debut Phone 1 smartphone. “Leaks are harder to contain nowadays and many of you have been waiting for a long time,” Pei wrote in a tweet. “So here it is.” The phone is due to be properly announced on July 12th at Nothing's next event.
