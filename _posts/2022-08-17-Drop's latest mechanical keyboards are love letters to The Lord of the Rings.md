A little under a year after Drop released a pair of keycap sets themed around the Elvish and Dwarvish languages from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, the mechanical keyboard retailer is following it up with two full-on keyboards. There's a gray Dwarvish board and a green Elvish counterpart, both of which are available fully assembled and ready to go out of the box. Both retail for $169, with preorders opening today, and Drop hopes to ship both by early October. I've been testing out the Elvish version over the last couple of days.
