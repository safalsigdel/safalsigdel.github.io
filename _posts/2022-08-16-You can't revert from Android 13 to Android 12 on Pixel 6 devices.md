Android 13 is now rolling out to Google's Pixel phones, but if you want to flash the update onto your Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, or Pixel 6A, with the company's custom Tensor chip, you won't be able to flash back to Android 12 because of a bootloader update, according to a notice on Google's developer website.
