Microsoft is announcing a new matte black option of its Surface Go 3 today, with optional LTE connectivity. The announcement comes just a day after images of the new Surface Go 3 model leaked online, with a new matte black finish. The new color option and LTE connectivity are the only changes, as it's identical to the regular Surface Go 3 otherwise.
