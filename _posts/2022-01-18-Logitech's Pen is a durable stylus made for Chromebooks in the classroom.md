Logitech has announced a new stylus called Pen, and it's aimed at being the best option available for classrooms full of Chromebooks. Unlike many rubber-tipped styli, the Pen is an active stylus that supports the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) standard, effectively guaranteeing one thing: it'll work out of the box on a number of recent Chromebooks — no pairing required.
