We're kicking off the week here at The Verge Deals with a pair of solid discounts on Sony earbuds. First off, Amazon is currently offering the first-ever discount on the Sony LinkBuds. Normally available for $179.99, you can currently get a pair for $158 at Amazon. This isn't a massive discount, but it's the lowest price we've seen yet for these unique earbuds.
