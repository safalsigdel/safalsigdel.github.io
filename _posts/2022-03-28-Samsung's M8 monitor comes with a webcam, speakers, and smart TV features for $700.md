Samsung's latest smart monitor, the 32-inch 4K M8, is now available to reserve in four colors: white, blue, green, and pink. The white-colored option will cost $699.99, while the other colors cost $30 more. Samsung announced the M8 during CES 2022, though it didn't share a price or that it would arrive in multiple colorways. The company still hasn't shared a release date. And for now, you can only reserve — not outright purchase — an M8 monitor. After you reserve by entering your e-mail address, you'll eventually be able to preorder one, and Samsung says your purchase will include a $100 Samsung credit to use in the future.
