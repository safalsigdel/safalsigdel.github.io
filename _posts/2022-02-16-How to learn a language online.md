Last year, I decided to start learning Korean. It was entirely on a whim — I don't live in Korea and have no reason I'd ever need to go there. Nonetheless, it's been an incredibly rewarding experience, and I've gotten to a point where I can speak, read, and write comfortably much faster than I ever thought I could.
