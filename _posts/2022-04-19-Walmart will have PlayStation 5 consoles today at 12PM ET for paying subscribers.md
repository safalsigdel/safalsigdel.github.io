It's time for another chance to buy the most sought-after console currently on the market: Sony's PlayStation 5. Walmart once again has a restock of PS5 consoles coming up for Walmart Plus subscribers. The members-only drop is scheduled for today, April 19th, at 12PM ET / 9AM PT, and it's set to include both the disc-based PS5 for $499 and the PS5 Digital Edition for $399. You'll need a paid Walmart Plus account to get a crack at either one (no free trials allowed), and while the premium subscription costs $98 annually, you can subscribe for just one month for $12.95 to try your hand at a PS5.
