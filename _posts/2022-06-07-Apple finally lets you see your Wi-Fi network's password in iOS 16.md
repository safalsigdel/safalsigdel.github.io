Apple is finally adding the ability to see your stored Wi-Fi password in iOS 16. MacRumors reports that the iOS 16 developer preview includes an option to view a Wi-Fi password and even copy it to share with friends or family. You need to authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode to see a stored password, and then you get an option to copy it.
