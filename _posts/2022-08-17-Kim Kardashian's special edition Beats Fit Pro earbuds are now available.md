Kim Kardashian's special edition Beats Fit Pro collection, first announced a week ago, is now available at Apple stores. The earbuds come in three neutral colors that were designed by Kardashian, matching her signature palette. “Since you're wearing something every day, I wanted them to be able to blend in. And I've never seen any tech products, especially headphones, be in neutral colors,” Kardashian said in a design video.
