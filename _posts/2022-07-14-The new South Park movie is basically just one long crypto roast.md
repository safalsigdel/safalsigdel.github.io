Matt Damon making that “Fortune Favors The Brave” commercial for Crypto.com will go down in history as one of the best things that ever happened to South Park. (And the worst thing that happened to a lot of crypto investments: if you put $1,000 into Bitcoin when the ad first aired last October, you'd have about $325 today.)
