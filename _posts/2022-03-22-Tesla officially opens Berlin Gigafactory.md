Tesla's fourth Gigafactory, and its first in Europe, is officially being opened today by the company's CEO Elon Musk, Reuters reports. The milestone was reached around two and a half years after Tesla initially announced its plans to build a factory on the site, which is located just outside the German capital of Berlin, and is officially called Giga Berlin-Brandenburg.
