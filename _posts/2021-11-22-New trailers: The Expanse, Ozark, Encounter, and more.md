Welp, The Morning Show season two finale was a messy disappointment much like the rest of the season. I think Linda Holmes' recap at NPR really nailed why a season that seemed full of promise never hit the mark, mostly because it couldn't quite figure out what it wanted to be. The latest season of Succession has yet to steer me wrong, however(and we learned this week that there is a fun Verge-related Succession backstory).
