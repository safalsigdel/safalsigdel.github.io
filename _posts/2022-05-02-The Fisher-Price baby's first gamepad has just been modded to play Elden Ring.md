I never thought I'd be writing about my baby's Fisher-Price gamepad again, but here we go: a modder has turned the cheap tune-filled toy into a complete Xbox gamepad with everything you'd need to play Elden Ring. And incredibly, he did so without losing any of the Fisher-Price Game & Learn Controller's built-in sound effects — meaning you can now pair your Malenia run with such classic kiddie hits as “1, 2, 3, 4, up goes your score!” and “Orange, purple, white and pink, green, red and blue, woohoo!”
