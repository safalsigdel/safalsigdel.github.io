One of the best deals of the week is on a product that isn't even out yet. If you preorder Samsung's 32-inch M8 4K smart monitor, starting at $699.99, before April 17th, you'll get a $100 Samsung credit to use on future purchases. Just a heads-up, though, that the white-colored model that costs $699.99 is currently set to deliver in early May. Other colors, like green and pink (which cost $30 more) will ship by April 18th. There's a blue option, but it's not available for preorder yet.
