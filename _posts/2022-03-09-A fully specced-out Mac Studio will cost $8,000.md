Apple's new Mac Studio has officially arrived on the scene as the most powerful computer powered by its in-house Apple silicon chips yet â€” including the new M1 Ultra processor the company announced alongside the new desktop computer. But the Mac Studio's power doesn't come cheap: while it starts at $1,999 for the entry model (powered by an M1 Max chip) and $3,999 for the cheapest M1 Ultra version, getting a fully specced-out machine will set you back an eye-watering $7,999.
