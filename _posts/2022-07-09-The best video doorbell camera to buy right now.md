A video doorbell is one of the most useful smart home devices you can buy. This one gadget will update your front door's communication skills from a 1980s landline to a 2022 smartphone. Combining a motion-activated camera with a microphone, speaker, and doorbell, a smart video doorbell sends alerts to your phone to show you who's calling without you having to open the door, or even be at home. Whether you're curled up on the couch, hard at work in a home (or actual) office, or sunning on a beach in the Bahamas, a video doorbell keeps you in touch with what's happening on your doorstep.
