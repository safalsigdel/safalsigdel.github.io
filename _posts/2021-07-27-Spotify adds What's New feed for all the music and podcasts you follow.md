What's New is a new section in the Spotify app that collects together new music and content from musicians and podcasts you follow on the platform. The feed, which is rolling out globally over the coming weeks on iOS and Android, will be accessible via a new bell icon on the top right of the app's home screen. A blue dot will show when there's new content in the feed, and artists and podcasts can be added by tapping the “Follow” button on their respective pages.
