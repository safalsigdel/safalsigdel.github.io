The latest 11-inch iPad Pro with an M1 processor is more affordable than ever before today at Amazon. The retail giant is currently selling the Wi-Fi version with 1TB for $1,299 (the space gray color sadly costs $1,429). As noted in our review, we loved the 2021 iPad Pro's blazing-fast M1 processor, its smaller form factor, and Apple's Center Stage feature, which tracks you in the frame while on video calls to keep you centered. It compensates for the fact that Apple still puts its selfie cam at the top of the tablet instead of along its side bezel. Read our review.
