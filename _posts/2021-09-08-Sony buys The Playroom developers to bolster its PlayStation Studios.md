Sony announced that it will acquire UK-based studio Firesprite, the developers of The Playroom and The Playroom VR. It's unclear what Firesprite might be working on in its new first-party capacity, but executives are already hyping what's to come. “Firesprite's ability to weave best-in-class gameplay with new technology is exceptional and I think fans will be excited about their creative vision for the future,” Hermen Hulst, the head of PlayStation Studios, said in a press release.
