When Google released the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, it boasted about the devices' fast-charging capabilities. Plugging a Pixel 6 series device into its $25 30W Fast Charger — which isn't even included in the box — is supposed to take full advantage of the phone's fast charging speed, juicing it up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes. We all can agree that this is an impressive spec, but unfortunately, it may not be totally realistic.
