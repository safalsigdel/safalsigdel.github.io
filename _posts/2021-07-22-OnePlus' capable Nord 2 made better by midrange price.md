OnePlus has officially announced the Nord 2, a successor to last year's excellent midrange debut. Like the original, the Nord 2 is releasing in Europe and India, and there are no plans for a US release. In Europe and the UK, prices start at xc2xa3399 / xe2x82xac399 for its 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model, rising to xc2xa3469 / xe2x82xac499 for a 12GB RAM / 256GB version (about $550 and $645, respectively). In the UK, preorders open on July 22nd from OnePlus.com and Amazon, and the phone goes on general sale on July 28th. You can read my first-hand impressions of the phone over in my full review.
