At first glance, there's nothing obviously special about mechanical keyboard retailer Drop's new collection of keycaps. There's one white set with black lettering, one black set with white letting, and one more colorful set with a combination of yellow, blue, red, and white keycaps. They're so understated that they almost look identical to what you'd find on an off-the-shelf keyboard, rather than the wacky designs that aftermarket keycaps are generally known for.
