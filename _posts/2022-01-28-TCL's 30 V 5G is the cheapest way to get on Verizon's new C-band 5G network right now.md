When Verizon lit up its new C-band 5G spectrum earlier this month, only a handful of flagship phones were ready to use the network. Starting today, there's a low-cost option if you're looking to get on C-band 5G right now: the $299 TCL 30 V 5G. Announced at CES, the 30 V 5G is a Verizon exclusive (for now, at least), and it supports all of the carrier's flavors of 5G: slower but widespread “Nationwide,” very fast but scarce mmWave, and the sweet C-band spectrum that sits in between, both in terms of coverage and speed.
