Playdate, the quirky new handheld with a black-and-white screen and a crank on its side created by Panic and co-designed with Teenage Engineering, will be available for preorder starting Thursday, July 29th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. You'll be able to secure a unit through the site play.date for $179. It'll start shipping later this year in select countries, though the company still doesn't have a concrete release date for the portable device. You can also preorder the Playdate Cover accessory that can protect the device for $29. If you preorder, you'll be charged immediately, but Panic says you can cancel at any time for a full refund.
