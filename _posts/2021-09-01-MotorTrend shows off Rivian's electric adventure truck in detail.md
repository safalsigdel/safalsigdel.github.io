Rivian's R1T electric pickup truck is finally set to ship next month after a series of delays â€” roughly three years after it debuted at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show. Ahead of the launch, though, MotorTrend got to spend a handful of days with the all-electric adventure truck, and the team there came away impressed by its performance. What's more, they offer one of the best looks at the R1T's interior, which borrows as much from Tesla as it does from other high-end off-road-focused vehicles.
