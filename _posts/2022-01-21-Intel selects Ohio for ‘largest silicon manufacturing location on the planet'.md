Chip manufacturer Intel will spend at least $20 billion on a new chip manufacturing site in New Albany, near Columbus, Ohio, Time reports. The plans are expected to be announced officially on Friday afternoon by Ohio officials, according to Cleveland.com, and the New York Times notes that Intel will discuss the expansion in a webcast later today. The 1,000-acre location will play host to two chip factories, and is set to directly employ at least 3,000 people. Construction is reportedly due to kick off this year, with the site becoming operational in 2025.
