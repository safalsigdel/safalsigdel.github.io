Sonos' latest update contains big news for surround sound fans: the addition of DTS audio support for its home theater speakers. These include not just newer speakers like the second-generation Beam and Arc, but also older devices like the first-gen Beam, the Playbar, and the Playbase. Even the Sonos Amp is getting in on the DTS action.
