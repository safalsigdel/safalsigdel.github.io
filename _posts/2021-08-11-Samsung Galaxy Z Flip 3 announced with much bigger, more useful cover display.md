For all the multitasking prowess and sheer productivity potential Samsung's new Galaxy Z Fold 3 offers, there's something about the just-announced Galaxy Z Flip 3 that's got me even more excited. Maybe it's the look: one of the colors is a fantastic cream hue that reminds me of vintage ‘70s gadgets. More likely, it's the larger outer display that's so much more practical and useful than the teeny, tiny cover display on the original Flip. There's an it factor about this phone that I can't put my finger on. Honestly, there's just a feeling of fun to the Flip 3 — right down to the stylish cases Samsung is making for it.
