Amazon will investigate allegations of discrimination and harassment within its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, following an employee petition that criticized AWS's culture, The Washington Post reported. More than 550 Amazon workers signed the petition, which calls out AWS for its “underlying culture of systemic discrimination, harassment, bullying and bias against women and under-represented groups,” the Post reported. The petition further alleges that Amazon's system to investigate claims of discrimination are “not fair, objective or transparent.”
