Google is updating its built-in password manager for Chrome and Android as it attempts to position it as an alternative to standalone services offered by 1Password and Bitwarden, the company announced today. Most significant is the ability to manually add passwords to the service, rather than simply relying on Chrome's offer to save credentials when you use them. There had previously been signs of this feature on Chrome on desktop, but now Google says it's making it available across “all platforms.”
