If you're looking to set up a security camera that can keep watch in areas without Wi-Fi, or that'll still be able to keep an eye on things if your home internet goes out, Arlo's new LTE-powered camera may be of interest. The $250 Arlo Go 2 LTE / Wi-Fi camera is built to go in somewhat remote places, like on a barn, cabin, or boat dock, and features full HD video recording (though saving that to the cloud will require a subscription, more on that later), weather resistance, and a rechargeable and swappable battery.
