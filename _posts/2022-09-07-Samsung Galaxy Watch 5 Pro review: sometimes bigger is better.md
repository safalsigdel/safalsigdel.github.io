I didn't think I was going to like the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. First came the rumors that this watch would be a behemoth. Then came the whispers suggesting Samsung had murdered its darling: the physical rotating bezel. Finally, leaked renders indicated that this watch was not only big but a heckin' chonker. If Samsung assembled a team to annoy the crap out of me, Victoria Song, specifically, this is the watch they would've come up with. And yet, the $449.99 Pro I ought to despise has pleasantly surprised me several times over the past few weeks.
