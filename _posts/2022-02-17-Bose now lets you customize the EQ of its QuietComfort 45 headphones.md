Owners of Bose's QuietComfort 45 noise-canceling headphones can now customize the bass, mid-range, and treble EQ settings to their liking. With a new firmware update released yesterday, the QC45s are no longer stuck on their default, out-of-the-box tuning. You can dial in your preferred settings or choose from a few of Bose's own presets, including bass boost, treble reducer, and so on.
