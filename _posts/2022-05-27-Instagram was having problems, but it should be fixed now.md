If you're having trouble accessing Instagram right now, you are not the only one. Reports across the internet (Downdetector, Reddit) note issues with Meta's more-than-just-pictures app, with many people seeing screens saying they're not logged in, blank image posts, “Welcome to Instagram” messages like they have a brand new account, or feeds that stop loading after the first few pictures.
