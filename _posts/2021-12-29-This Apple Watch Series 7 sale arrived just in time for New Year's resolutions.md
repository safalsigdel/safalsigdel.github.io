If getting fit is one of your New Year's resolutions, or if you, like me, are ending the holiday season feeling so bloated you can barely carry your own weight from all of that food (true story), today's Apple Watch Series 7 discount couldn't have arrived at a better time. At Amazon, both sizes of the Series 7, Apple's latest model that boasts a larger display than its predecessor, are discounted now. At the moment, the retailer is selling the 45mm model sporting a blue aluminum case with an abyss blue sport band for $379 instead of $429.
