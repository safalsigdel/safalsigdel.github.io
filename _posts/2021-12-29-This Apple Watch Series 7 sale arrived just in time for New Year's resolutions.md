If getting fit is one of your New Year's resolutions, or if you, like me, are ending the holiday season feeling so bloated you can barely carry your own weight from all of that food (true story), today's Apple Watch Series 7 discount couldn't have arrived at a better time. Both sizes of the Series 7, Apple's latest model that boasts a larger display than its predecessor, are discounted at Amazon. At the moment, the retailer is selling the 45mm, GPS-equipped model with a blue aluminum case and a blue Sport Band for $379 instead of $429.
