You'd expect a lot from Amazon's first self-branded TVs. After building a successful hardware business with its Echo smart devices and Fire TV streaming gadgets, now the tech giant wants to put its name on the biggest screen in your home. The new Fire TV Omni series delivers 4K HDR picture in multiple sizes that start at aggressively low prices: the 50-inch model costs $359.99 at the time of this review. Only the largest 65-inch and 75-inch models include Dolby Vision HDR, which, in Amazon's own words, allows for “a more cinematic experience.” All of the Omni TVs run Amazon's Fire TV software and have built-in mics for hands-free Alexa voice commands — even when the screen is off. There's also a cheaper Fire TV 4-Series on sale now, but I'm reviewing the higher-end series.
