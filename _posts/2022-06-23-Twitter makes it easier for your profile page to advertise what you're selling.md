Twitter is partnering with Shopify on an integration that will keep a seller's Twitter profile page updated with direct links to the products they have for sale. Shopify users who install the new Twitter add-on can connect their Twitter account with Shopify and then start building out a store on Twitter with the platform's Shop Module.
