Russia's communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, has threatened to fine Google over its failure to follow the country's orders to remove certain “illegal” YouTube videos, as first reported by The Washington Post. In a translated version of its post on Telegram, the Roskomnadzor warns it may fine the tech company up to 8 million rubles (about $94,675 USD), an amount that will increase to 20 percent of Google's annual revenue in case of a repeat offense.
