Hello! I am back in NYC after a whirlwind couple of days in Dallas last week. It was really great to meet so many people from the industry in person. My biggest takeaway from Podcast Movement week is how much the podcast format has evolved (for better or worse). Video podcasts were the hot topic, with lots of discussions on how to pivot to video and whether it's necessary to do so. As one exec told me, video is not for everyone! It's much easier to produce professional-quality audio than video, and a lot of podcast genres don't actually lend themselves to video. I will be curious to see if it's as big of a topic next year — maybe by then, creators will have tried and abandoned the practice.
