Disney CEO Bob Chapek addressed criticism over the company's handling of Florida's “Don't Say Gay” bill today, saying he called the state's governor to express “concern” with the bill and pledged millions to charity in response to its passing. Chapek said that the company's initial response, “no matter how well-intended, didn't quite get the job done, but we're committed to support the community going forward.”
