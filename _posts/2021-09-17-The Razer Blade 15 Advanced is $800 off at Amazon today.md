Gaming laptops are by no means cheap, but today you can save $800 on the Razer Blade 15 Advanced at Amazon. This laptop was built expressly for the purpose of delivering desktop gaming performance in a laptop form factor. Packing an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q graphics card and a 10875H Intel processor capable of topping out at 5.0GHz, the Razer Blade 15 does exactly that. The FHD display has a 300Hz refresh rate, better than you'd see on most desktop gaming monitors, allowing for sharp reaction times and virtually no lag, letting you get the drop on your enemy. A 1TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of RAM round out the laptop's specs, offering you plenty of onboard storage and speed. Read our Razer Blade 15 Advanced review.
