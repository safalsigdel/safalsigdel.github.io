You may not realize it, but we're living in a golden age of gaming controllers. The gamepads on the market now are better quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from just a few console generations ago. That includes the plethora of third-party options from the likes of PowerA, Scuf, Nacon, and Turtle Beach, as well as first-party controllers from the console makers. The days of the cheap, “little sibling” controller that looked cool but barely worked are over.
