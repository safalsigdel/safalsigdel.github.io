Like clockwork, Apple announced a new Apple Watch model at its September “California Streaming” event alongside the iPhone 13, iPad, and iPad Mini. The Apple Watch Series 7 is the latest flagship and sits atop Apple's current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration — each with optional cellular radios. After Apple's initial announcement billed them for release “later this fall,” we now know the new models are set to release on October 15th, and you can preorder them on Apple's site beginning Friday, October 8th at 5AM PT / 8AM ET.
