Microsoft is bringing Dolby Vision gaming support to its Xbox Series X / S consoles today. The feature has been in testing since May and will be available in more than 100 HDR games in the future. While Xbox has supported the HDR10 standard for years, Dolby Vision gaming is appearing first on Xbox consoles and offers support for dynamic metadata. Microsoft says this should result in “brighter highlights, sharper contrast, and more vibrant colors.”
