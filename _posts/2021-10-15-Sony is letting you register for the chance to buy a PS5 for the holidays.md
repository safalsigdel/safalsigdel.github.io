Sony has launched a landing page where you can register for the opportunity to buy a PS5 later this year, in time for the holidays. The company says it will have “a limited amount of PS5 consoles” for US customers through its PlayStation store. It's probably a good idea to fill out the registration sooner than later, and you'll need a PlayStation Network ID to do so. Though, unlike its queueing system for distributing consoles, the selection process here doesn't seem entirely like a first-come, first-served situation.
