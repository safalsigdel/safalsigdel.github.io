Robinhood has announced a new debit card, branded as the Robinhood Cash Card. The card will be linked to a spending account separate to users' brokerage accounts, and work for in-person and online payments as well as ATM withdrawals. The new card will replace Robinhood's current Cash Management debit card, originally announced in 2019.
