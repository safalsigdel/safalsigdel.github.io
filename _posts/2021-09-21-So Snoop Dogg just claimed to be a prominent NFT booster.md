Snoop Dogg, the famous rapper, tweeted on Monday that he's the one behind a Twitter account that discusses NFTs. Yes, this really is a thing that's happened. While Snoop Dogg has released NFTs before, that's not really anything new for celebrities â€” running a Twitter account that constantly tweets about crypto, and owning around a hundred of the crypto tokens, however, would be another level. Is this reveal real? A prank? It's unclear, but it sure is interesting.
