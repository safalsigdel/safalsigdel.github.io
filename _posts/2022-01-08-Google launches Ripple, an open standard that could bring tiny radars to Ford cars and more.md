Google has been publicly building tiny radar chips since 2015. They can tell you how well you sleep, control a smartwatch, count sheets of paper, and let you play the world's tiniest violin. But the company's Soli radar hasn't necessarily had commercial success, most prominently featuring in an ill-fated Pixel phone.
