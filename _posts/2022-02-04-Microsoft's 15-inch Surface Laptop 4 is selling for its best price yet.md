Need a sleek 15-inch laptop that's powerful but won't totally break the bank? Today, the Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 is available at a new all-time low. Amazon is currently selling the laptop with an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU, xe2x80x8e8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD for $1,288.99 instead of $1,499.99. In her review, The Verge's Monica Chin praised the device for being such a massive improvement over its predecessor, the aptly-titled Surface Laptop 3. She was also impressed by the laptop's excellent battery life, lightweight build, and tall 3:2 display. While it released in April 2021, it remains a good buy if you're looking for an efficient Windows machine and don't mind its distinct lack of ports.
