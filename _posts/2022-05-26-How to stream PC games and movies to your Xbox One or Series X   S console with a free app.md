If you own a Windows 10 or 11 PC and an Xbox One or Series X / S console, you might not be aware that those devices have some interesting cross-functionality. Using Microsoft's Wireless Display app, you can easily output the games from your Xbox to your Windows PC screen. Conversely, it's possible to stream what's on your PC to the TV that you're using with your Xbox â€” you can even control it from the console, and setting it up is surprisingly simple.
