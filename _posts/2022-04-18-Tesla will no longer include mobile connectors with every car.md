Tesla has stopped including its mobile connector with new car purchases, and will instead sell its Gen 2 (Level 1) bundle separately for a lower $200 price, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed in a series of tweets. The mobile connector bundle comes with an adapter that allows drivers to charge their cars from a standard 110v household outlet, with other adapters available for purchase separately.
