On Thursday, I wrote that Twitter was having a rough February after experiencing issues for the second time in a week, and on Friday, the company was dealing with a strange iMessage bug. If you were on an Apple device and texting a tweet to your buddy on an Apple device, the first and last characters in the tweet wouldn't show up. As reported by 9to5Mac, tweet previews sent via iMessage seemed to be missing the first and last characters of the tweet, making them read oddly.
