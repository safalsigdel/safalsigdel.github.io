Google just announced a batch of new Pixel products at its I/O 2022 keynote. Among them is a new midrange Pixel phone, the Pixel 6A; some new premium wireless earbuds, the Pixel Buds Pro; and Google's first wearable, the Pixel Watch. This is a healthy amount of new tech to come out of the online developer conference, in addition to what's coming soon for Android 13 and other Google services, but let's not start camping out in lines at the Google Store and various Best Buy locations just yet.
