Starting on March 16th, 2022, when you first sign in to your Disney Plus subscription, you're going to be asked to select content ratings for all of the users in your family â€” a reflection of the network's new parental controls. When you open the app, you'll be asked if you want to change your content rating from TV-14, which is somewhat restricted to TV-MA (no restrictions). If you don't choose, you will be automatically slotted into a TV-14 rating.
