Apple's “communication safety in Messages” feature, which is designed to automatically blur images containing nudity sent to children using the company's messaging service, is now rolling out to additional countries. After launching in the US last year, the feature is now coming to the Messages apps on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS for users in the UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Exact timings are unclear, but The Guardian reports that the feature is coming to the UK “soon.”
