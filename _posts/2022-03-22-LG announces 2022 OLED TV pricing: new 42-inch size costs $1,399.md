Just as Samsung did last week, LG is today sharing its official pricing for the company's 2022 lineup of TVs. First up is the OLED family, which is comprised of several different series lines, including the G2 Gallery Edition, C2, B2, and A2 series. The G2 is the flagship and includes the brightest OLED TV panel that LG has produced yet, though the C2's display is also getting a brightness boost over last year's model. Both are being achieved with the help of increased processing power and “Brightness Booster” features.
