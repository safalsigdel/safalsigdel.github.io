When it comes to smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of voice-enabled Echo devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. Maybe you want to add Alexa to a room, for example, or you're looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your lighting or other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, this is one of the best times of the year to pick up an Echo device, especially as early Black Friday deals begin to ramp in preparation for the main event.
