In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision on Friday to overturn Roe v. Wade, Google's chief people officer Fiona Cicconi sent a staff-wide email to employees informing them of Google's response to the ruling. Among other things, the email highlights that Googlers can “apply for relocation without justification” and that people in charge of the relocation process “will be aware of the situation” in assessing their requests. In an email last August reported by Bloomberg, Google told employees that of 10,000 requests over the prior few months to work remotely or relocate, 85 percent were approved.
