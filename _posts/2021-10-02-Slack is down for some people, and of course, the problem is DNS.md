Slack appears to be having issues for some people, with reports coming in of users who can't connect to the service, receive errors when trying to send messages, and can't even access Slack's website. The issue doesn't appear to affect everyone, and Slack hasn't gone as far as calling it an outage on its status page. The differences in experiences pointed to a possible routing issue or the even more likely culprit, DNS (it's always DNS).
