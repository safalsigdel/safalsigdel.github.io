Amazon is today introducing a new flagship streaming stick that joins the Fire TV Stick 4K, Fire TV Stick, and Fire TV Stick Lite. Dubbed the “Fire TV Stick 4K Max” (sigh) and priced at $54.99, the company's latest device has improved processing power, more memory, and also adds speedier Wi-Fi 6 wireless networking.
