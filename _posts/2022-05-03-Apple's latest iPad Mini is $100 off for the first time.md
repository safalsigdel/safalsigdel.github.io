There's a veritable spoil of deals happening today, and I'm excited to share some of them with you. The most impressive (and unexpected) deal is on Apple's 2021 iPad Mini, which received a design overhaul similar to the iPad Air. Normally $499.99 for the 64GB Wi-Fi version, you can get it for just $399.99 today at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. That beats the best-ever price by nearly $50. Given that it's such an aggressive, out-of-nowhere deal, this one might see some color options sell out quickly. And if you're interested in more storage, the 256GB configuration is $100 off, too, costing $549.99 instead of $649.99.
