Google announced it's updating the Gmail iOS widget with a new one that's actually useful, showing you the subjects and senders of the emails sitting in your inbox. The company says the new widget will be “launching in the next few weeks,” to replace the previous version that wasn't particularly well-received. This also means that, as 9to5Google points out, this means that Gmail's iOS widget will have the same functionality as the current Android one.
