Picking an Apple Watch used to be very simple. All you had to do was choose what size you wanted. Then the Series 3 introduced cellular connectivity in 2017, which added another factor to consider. And then, in 2020, Apple introduced yet another model in the form of the more affordable Apple Watch SE. Later this year, it's rumored that Apple may expand its lineup even further with a rugged Apple Watch for outdoor enthusiasts. So, if you're looking to buy an Apple Watch right now, what do you do?
