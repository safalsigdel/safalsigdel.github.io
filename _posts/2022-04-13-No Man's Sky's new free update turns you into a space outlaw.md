Hello Games has released yet another large free update to No Man's Sky. This one's called Outlaws, and it delivers a set of missions where the player can acquire black market tech and other essential goods from other ships in a less-than-savory manner â€” and then smuggle it for a profit. There are also bounty missions and planetary raids. There will be high-conflict zones in areas where outlaws have captured space stations where you'll have plenty of chances to engage in dogfights. Oh, and there are now capes and hoods that you can unlock for your character.
