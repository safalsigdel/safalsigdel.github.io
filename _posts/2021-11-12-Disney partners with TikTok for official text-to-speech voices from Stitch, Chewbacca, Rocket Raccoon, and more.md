Disney is teaming up with TikTok to add official character voices to the popular social media app's text-to-speech feature, allowing you to have your captions read by Lilo and Stitch's Stitch, C-3PO, Chewbacca, a Stormtrooper from Star Wars, and Rocket Raccoon from Guardians of the Galaxy. The new character voices are rolling out in the app today as part of the Disney Plus Day promotional holiday celebrating the two-year anniversary of the service.
