Logitech has a trio of colorful new peripherals coming to the US this month: a $99.99 Pop Keys keyboard, a $39.99 Pop Mouse, and a $19.99 Desk Mat. In contrast with Logitech's usual sensibly styled and office-appropriate peripherals, these Studio Series devices are bright and cutesy. They're each available in three color-coordinate schemes: yellow and black; pink; and purple and yellow options.
