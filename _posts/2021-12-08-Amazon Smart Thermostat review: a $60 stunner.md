Since the Nest Learning Thermostat launched in 2011, no other smart thermostat has emulated its core function â€” learning your schedule and adapting to it automatically, so you don't have to lift a finger. This feature has made the Nest one of the best smart thermostats (lots of) money can buy for years. But just a decade on, Amazon has finally done it. The online shopping giant's $60 Amazon Smart Thermostat can intelligently determine if you're home, away, or sleeping and automatically adjust your climate to keep you comfortable and potentially save you money. And you don't have to program anything.
