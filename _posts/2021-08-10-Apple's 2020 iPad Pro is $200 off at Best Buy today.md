If you've been waiting for a sale on last year's iPad Pro now that the new models have been released, today is perhaps your day. Best Buy is taking $200 off all configurations of the 2020 iPad Pro, including both 11- and 12.9-inch sizes and cellular-equipped models. Not all of the configurations are in stock everywhere, but popular options like the 256GB Wi-Fi versions of the 11-inch and the 12.9-inch are available as of the time of publish.
