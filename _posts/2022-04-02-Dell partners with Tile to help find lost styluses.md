Dell's new stylus, the Premier Rechargeable Active Pen, has a neat trick up its sleeve that makes it easier to find when misplaced. It features built-in finding technology provided by Tile, which means you can use the object-tracing company's app to make the stylus buzz and flash its LED lights to help you find it when it's nearby. If you lose it further afield, Tile says its app will be able to show its last known location, and use its network to track it down.
