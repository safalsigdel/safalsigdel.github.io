The Nintendo Switch is one of the most popular consoles ever released, one with an ever-expanding library of games to choose from. Odds are if a game is capable of working on the Switch's hardware, it's either already available, or it will be soon. Thankfully, having a massive library of games also means there are often regular price breaks on a variety of titles, from first-gen offerings like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey to remasters like Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1+2.
