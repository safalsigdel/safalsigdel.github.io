It's too hot to go outside (at least here in California), so if you xe2x80x93 like me xe2x80x93 are spending a lot of quality time with the TV while feeling guilty about the lack of culture in your life, you might appreciate today's deal. Samsung's latest version of The Frame is a unique 4K TV like no other that, in a way, brings a little bit of the museum experience home that you can enjoy in between binging on your favorite shows. That's because xe2x80x93 when you're not using it xe2x80x93 the gorgeous screen displays artwork that, thanks to the new anti-glare, low-reflection matte coating, bears a remarkable resemblance to an actual canvas painting you see hanging in museums. When turned on, however, it transforms into a QLED TV with a speedy 120Hz refresh rate and support for several streaming apps.
