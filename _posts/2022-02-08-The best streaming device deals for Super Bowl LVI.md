An annual February tradition is once again fast approaching. We want to be sure you're prepared and help you spend your money wisely. Is it Valentine's Day, you ask? No, but we've got you covered there, too. It's the day before that, the Super Bowl — also known as the “big game” if you're an American or an advertiser legally barred from using the trademarked term. Whether you're into the actual game of football and rooting for the Los Angeles Rams or Cincinnati Bengals — or you're just there for the commercials, snacks, and halftime show — you want to ensure the stream you're watching looks good.
