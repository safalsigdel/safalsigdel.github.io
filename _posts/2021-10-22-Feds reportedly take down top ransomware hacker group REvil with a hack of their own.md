The government has successfully hacked the hacking group REvil, the entity behind the ransomware that's been linked to leaked Apple leaks, attacks on enterprise software vendors, and more, according to a report from Reuters. The outlet's sources tell it that the FBI, Secret Service, Cyber Command, and organizations from other countries have worked together to take the group's operations offline this month. The group's dark web blog, which exposed information gleaned from its targets, is also reportedly offline.
