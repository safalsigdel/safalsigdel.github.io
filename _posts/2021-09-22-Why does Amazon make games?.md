When Amazon makes a new movie or TV show, the reason is pretty clear: the tech giant needs to build out its streaming service Prime Video. One of the best ways to do that is to make (or buy) exclusive series and films. But when Amazon develops a new video game, the reasons aren't so clear. The company's upcoming MMO, New World, isn't exclusive to Amazon's Luna cloud service or Twitch (which Amazon also owns). It's a regular PC game you can buy on Steam.
