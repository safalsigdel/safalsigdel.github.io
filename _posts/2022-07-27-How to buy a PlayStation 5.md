As Sony's PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Digital Edition approach their second birthday, supplies of both of next-gen consoles may finally be catching up with demand. Both models still tend to sell out quickly during restock events, but the window for snagging a console online and in-store has become somewhat more forgiving in recent months. The process for buying a PS5 online hasn't changed all that much, however, many retailers have made stocks more readily available at their brick-and-mortar locations. Thankfully, there are also still a number of ways to keep on top of supply whenever an online retailer or a store near you gets a fresh batch of the next-gen machines.
