Gigabyte has released a minor refresh to the Aero 15 OLED, its flagship laptop targeting gamers and creative professionals. Like last year's model, this Aero 15 has a 4K OLED display and a decent port selection with Thunderbolt 4 and HDMI 2.1. Also like last year's model, it has a somewhat clunky aluminum design, a flashy RGB keyboard, a fingerprint sensor in the trackpad, and a webcam inconveniently located underneath the screen. The big change is that the Aero 15 now includes Intel's latest 11th Gen processors and Nvidia's RTX 3070 graphics card.
