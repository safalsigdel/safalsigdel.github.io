It doesn't take long to realize why Snap's first true AR glasses aren't for sale. The overall design is the highest quality of any standalone AR eyewear I've tried, and they make it easy to quickly jump into a variety of augmented-reality experiences, from a multiplayer game to a virtual art installation. But the first pair I was handed during a recent demo overheated after about 10 minutes, and the displays are so small that I wouldn't want to look through them for a long period of time, even if the battery allowed for it.
