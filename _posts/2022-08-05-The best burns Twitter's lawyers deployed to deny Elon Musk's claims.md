So I don't know entirely what's in Elon Musk's counterclaims against Twitter — they are still under seal — but I did get an inkling today, when Twitter dropped its response. It's spicy! Rather than let Musk get his complaints out first, Twitter went ahead and released a blow-by-blow response, the better with which to dunk on Elon along the way.
