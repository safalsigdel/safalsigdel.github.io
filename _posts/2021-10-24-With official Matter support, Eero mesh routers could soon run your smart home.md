We are literally right now celebrating The Verge's 10-year anniversary in New York City, but we couldn't throw an epic two-day event without also bringing you a teensy bit of tech news â€” and Eero co-founder and CEO Nick Weaver just did that at On The Verge. Weaver says that Eero, an early adopter of the Thread protocol, will be upgrading all its Thread-equipped Wi-Fi routers to fully support Matter as well. Matter is the upcoming 2022 standard that should allow for easier setup of smart home devices, with any compatible Matter host able to discover and work with any Matter client. Amazon smart home rivals Apple and Google are also on board with Matter.
