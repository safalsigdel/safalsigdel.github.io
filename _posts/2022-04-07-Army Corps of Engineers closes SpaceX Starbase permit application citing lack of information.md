The US Army Corps of Engineers has closed a permit application for a proposed expansion of SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas â€” a potential snag in the company's plans to add new launch and landing pads to the area, as well as substantially grow the site. In a letter viewed by The Verge, the Corps cited SpaceX's failure to provide requested follow-up information about the proposed changes as a reason for closing the permit. Among other things, the Corps wanted more details about what mitigation measures the company would take to limit the loss of water and wetlands surrounding the site.
