I'll admit that rowing has never really been my jam. Aside from a handful of times I've used it during an Orangetheory class, it's a sport I mostly associate with the Winklevoss twins. Still, I've seen and heard plenty of folks extoll the virtues of rowing as a highly efficient form of low-impact cardio and strength training â€” I just didn't feel interested enough to publicly attempt it on the sad, neglected rower at my local gym. So with that in mind, I was curious but skeptical of the $1,495 Hydrow Wave.
