Whether you're trying to quickly record ideas, an interview, or even a song idea, a voice recording app on your iPhone can come in useful. While Apple's App Store is filled with third-party apps that can do that for you, Apple's built-in Voice Memos app is particularly easy to use, given there's no need to download anything — and it's totally free. Plus, once you're finished recording your voice note, you can also easily share it — and even edit the recording if need be. Below, we'll guide you through just how to do so.
