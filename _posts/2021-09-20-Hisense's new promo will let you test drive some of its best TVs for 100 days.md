Buying a TV can be a big decision, but Hisense's latest promotion wants to help; starting today the company is offering what it calls its “100 Day Guarantee,” which will let you buy a Hisense TV, try it out for 100 days in the comfort of your own living room, and then, if you don't like it, you can send it back for a full refund.
