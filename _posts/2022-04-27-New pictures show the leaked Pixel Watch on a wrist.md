We're now getting a look at what the leaked Pixel Watch looks like strapped to somebody's wrist, courtesy of Reddit user tagtech414, who's previously shared alleged images of Google's as-yet-unannounced wearable (via 9to5Google). In the previous pictures, we could only see the little computer puck itself, not attached to a strap. While tagtech414 doesn't seem to have successfully booted the device yet, they've given us a better idea of what it might be like to actually wear it.
