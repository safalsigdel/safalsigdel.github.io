Sonos products are an easy sell, at least when the price is right. Like most products in the Sonos lineup, the Sonos Arc features a clean design and excellent sound quality, the latter of which is evident while listening to everything from Dolby Atmos movies to the lush sounds of The National's most recent album, I Am Easy to Find. What's more, the all-in-one soundbar includes built-in support for Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as Apple's AirPlay 2. Granted, you'll need a recent TV that supports Atmos over HDMI ARC to truly unlock the Arc's potential, but if you have one, it's a great way to future-proof your home theater setup. Normally $800 and rarely discounted, the white iteration of the Sonos Arc is currently on sale at Wellbots for $50 off with promo code DADMUSIC. Read our review.
