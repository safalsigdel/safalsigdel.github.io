Black Friday is actually more a weekend than a single day, and Cyber Monday is the perfect end-cap to it. Several popular streaming services are offering a number of discounts ahead of Cyber Monday. New and even some previous subscribers can, for example, enjoy a year of Hulu for just $0.99 a month. While that's probably one of the best deals out there this year, other services are also great limited-time offers for new, past, and even existing subscribers alike. Below, we've curated some of the best we've seen this year to help you get the best bang for your buck.
