iOS 15.4, the latest version of Apple's iPhone operating system, has been released and should soon be available to download ahead of the Friday release of Apple's new third-generation iPhone SE and green iPhone 13. The update includes big new features like the ability to use Face ID while wearing a mask, alongside smaller additions like a handful of new emoji. The new version of iOS launches alongside iPadOS 15.4 and macOS 12.3, which add support for Apple's new Universal Control feature.
