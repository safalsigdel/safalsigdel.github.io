Gadget skin-maker Dbrand is announcing that its line of adhesive leather skins for smartphones and laptops are now available for sale once again, and this time, they will remain as a permanent fixture in its online store. The vegetable-tanned genuine leather skins first launched as a limited-edition run back in December and are now back due to popular demand. The 3M adhesive leather skins sell for around $34.95 for smartphones and $69.95 for laptops and are available in black, brown, and tan colorways for over 100 products, including the new Samsung Galaxy S22, iPhones, MacBooks, Google Pixels, and gaming consoles.
