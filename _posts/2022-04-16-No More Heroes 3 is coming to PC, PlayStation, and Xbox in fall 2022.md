Games publisher Xseed announced via Twitter that No More Heroes 3, which was released for the Nintendo Switch in August 2021, is coming to the PC, PS4, PS5, and Xbox consoles in the fall. Presumably, digital versions will be available, but the sole picture shared by Xseed shows limited-edition physical copies of the game that include an art book, a faux license plate, and a soundtrack CD adorned with the most obvious Akira reference. Xseed hasn't yet shared a price for No More Heroes 3 on these new platforms.
