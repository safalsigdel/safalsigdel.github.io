Anyone who owns a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 should consider becoming a PlayStation Plus subscriber â€” it's one of the best deals in gaming, after all. Thankfully, if you're not currently a subscriber or want to extend your membership, you can pick up a year of PS Plus at Eneba for $37 by using promo code VergePSPLUS at checkout. Once subscribed, you'll be able to take advantage of a variety of perks, including 100GB of cloud storage, online multiplayer, exclusive member discounts, and free monthly titles. If you own a PS5, you'll also be able to play select PS4 games like God of War and The Last of Us through the PS Plus Collection. Our Verge-exclusive deal is only valid through October 3rd, however, so you'll want to hustle.
