Sony has enlisted accessory company Backbone to make a PlayStation-ified version of the excellent Backbone One mobile controller for iPhone. It gives off PS Vita vibes, except somehow, Sony was okay with Backbone keeping its Xbox-like analog stick arrangement. The $99.99 controller, which can be pulled open to fit iPhones as small as the 13 Mini and as big as the 13 Pro Max, comes in a new mix of white and black, just like the PS5's DualSense controller. Sure, this is a pricier workaround than strapping one of Sony's controllers to your phone, but it's a more elegant-looking way to play PlayStation games via Remote Play, Sony's mobile app that streams games from your PS4 or PS5 console.
