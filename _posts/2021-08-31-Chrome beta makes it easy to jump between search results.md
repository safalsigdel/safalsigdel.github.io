Google is announcing some new experiments available in the latest Chrome beta intended to make it easier to find things on the web and share interesting text. If you want to jump onto the Chrome beta to give these features a shot, download it here for your computer or here for your Android device. (Though as with all betas, exercise caution, as things may not work perfectly.) And I'm going to mention enabling flags throughout â€” to do so, enter chrome://flags into your address bar, which is where you can turn on Chrome's many available experiments.
