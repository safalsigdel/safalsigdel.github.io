Frankly, now that we've seen a leather case for your MagSafe charging puck, it's all uphill from here. At least Apple's new $99 MagSafe Battery Pack is something you'll actually be carrying around and touching on a regular basis, where leather might make it nicer to hold. Perhaps you already have a matching leather case for your iPhone, too? It looks like a nice combo in photos. If you agree, Nomad is currently taking preorders for $30 each, shipping this November.
