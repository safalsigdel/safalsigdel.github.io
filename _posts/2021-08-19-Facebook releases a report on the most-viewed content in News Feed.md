Facebook has released a report to show what content was most widely viewed by Americans in the last quarter, and the list includes a post from President Biden, a video from 5-Minute Crafts, and arguments about whether you should put sugar on spaghetti. Facebook's report comes as a response to frequent reports that some of the platform's posts with the most interaction are from right-wing sources that critics say could have a radicalizing effect on users. Facebook says that the report shows what people actually see on the platform, as opposed to what content on Facebook gets the most interaction, and that it'll be creating these reports on a quarterly basis in the future. However, the picture the report paints is, by Facebook's own admission, an incomplete one.
