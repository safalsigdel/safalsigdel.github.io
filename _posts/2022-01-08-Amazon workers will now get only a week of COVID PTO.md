Amazon has changed its PTO policy for workers forced to quarantine, as reported by CNBC and the Wall Street Journal. The policy has shrunk to one week (or 40 hours) off, down from its initial length of 14 days, which is still mentioned on an Amazon hiring page (via Engadget) but had already been shortened to ten days. Engadget's report includes an excerpt of Amazon's notice to employees about the change, citing the CDC's updated recommendations that people who have tested positive for COVID should isolate for five days, as long as their symptoms are gone.
