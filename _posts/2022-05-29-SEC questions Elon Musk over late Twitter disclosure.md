The US Securities and Exchange Commission is scrutinizing Elon Musk's initial disclosure that he'd taken a substantial stake in Twitter. In a letter sent last month, the SEC told Musk that he “does not appear” to have disclosed his acquisition of Twitter shares within the agency's required 10-day window. The agency also suggested that Musk likely used the wrong form when he eventually disclosed his stake, using a document that wasn't meant for someone who was hoping to make changes at the company being bought into.
