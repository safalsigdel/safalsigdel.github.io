Huawei is set to announce a new foldable phone later this month called the Huawei P50 Pocket, according to a post on the company's official Weibo account. Unlike its previous Mate X foldables, which fold from a device the size of a tablet into a smartphone, the P50 Pocket has a clamshell design that folds out to the size of a smartphone. It's a similar design to Samsung's Z Flip devices, or the Motorola Razr.
