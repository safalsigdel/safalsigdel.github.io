Elon Musk allegedly fractured an old friendship with Google co-founder Sergey Brin after having an affair with his wife, Nicole Shanahan, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. Sources familiar with the situation told the WSJ that the couple filed for divorce earlier this year, citing “irreconcilable differences,” however, Musk has now denied both the alleged affair and said he is still friends with Brin, claiming the report is based only on “third-party random hearsay.”
