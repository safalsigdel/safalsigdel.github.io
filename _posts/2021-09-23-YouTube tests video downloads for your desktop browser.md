YouTube is testing an official way to download videos on your desktop web browser (via Android Police). If you want to see if you're eligible for the test, which runs through October 19th, check out YouTube's experimental features page, which lists tests available for Premium subscribers. I was able to opt in to the test, but a colleague of mine wasn't, which seems to indicate that not everyone is able to try the feature just yet.
