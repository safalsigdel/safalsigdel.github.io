Android 11's auto-resetting permissions, where the operating system will restrict an app's permission to access sensitive phone features like its storage or cameras if it hasn't been opened for several months, are coming to older devices, Google has announced. The feature originally launched with Android 11 last year, but soon it'll be available on any phones running Android 6 and above with Google Play services, which Google says should cover “billions” of Android phones released since 2015.
