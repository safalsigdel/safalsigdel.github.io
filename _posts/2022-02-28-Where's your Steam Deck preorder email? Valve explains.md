Valve's $400-and-up portable gaming PC the Steam Deck went on sale this morning... but you didn't get an email from Valve, I'm guessing? I didn't either â€” and as Valve's just now explaining, that's because they're going out in small batches rather than all at once; the next batch won't be arriving until Monday, March 7th; and then they'll go out in weekly batches each Monday, presumably through the month of June.
