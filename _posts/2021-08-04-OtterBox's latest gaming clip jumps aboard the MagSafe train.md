OtterBox's latest gaming controller clip is MagSafe-compatible for iPhone 12 devices, and it costs $39.99. Compared to its previous $30 gaming clip that we reviewed earlier this year, it streamlines the process of connecting your phone to a controller clip by letting it snap on seamlessly with the help of magnets â€” in other words, MagSafe technology (TM). This solution is preferable to traditional controller clips that clamp around the edges of your phone's display. I just wish that this one worked with other phones.
