While Sony's WH-1000XM5 recently debuted with a higher price and just a couple of improvements, you can pick up the still very good XM4 model for a low price at Woot. Normally $348, the silver model is available new for $259.99. It's been about six months since we've seen a price beat this one. (Amazon sold them for $248 around Black Friday.)
