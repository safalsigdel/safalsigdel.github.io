Google Chrome is rolling out Journeys, a feature that lets you revisit your old browsing sessions based on the subject matter you were searching for. If you type a word in the address bar that's related to some convoluted rabbit hole you've been down in the past, you'll see a “Resume your research” option that links you to the related sites you've visited before.
