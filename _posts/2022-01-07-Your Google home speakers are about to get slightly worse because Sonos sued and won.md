If you have multiple Google smart speakers in your house, you might want to be aware of a certain legal ruling — because it's going to affect how your speaker groups work. After the US International Trade Commission ruled that it was infringing on Sonos' patents, Google has already announced software workarounds including the “need to adjust each speaker individually instead of using the group volume controller,” and that users will no longer be able to adjust a speaker group's volume with their phone's volume rocker. It blames this change on “a recent legal ruling,” one which you can read all about right here.
