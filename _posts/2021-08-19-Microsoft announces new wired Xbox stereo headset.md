Microsoft has unveiled a refreshed Xbox stereo headset, a $59.99 wired model that's more affordable than its stellar $100 wireless headset that launched earlier in 2021. It's launching on September 21st, and as is to be expected, it's missing a few features. But much of its design is intact. You can twist the dial on the outside of the right ear cup to adjust the volume, and there's a mute button on the back side of the flexible microphone â€” mirroring what you get with the wireless version. The stereo headset doesn't appear to have the chat / game audio mixing dial on the left ear cup as the pricier model does, but that's not a horrible loss given the price difference.
