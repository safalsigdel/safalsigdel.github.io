Google has started selling a new bundle that gives you some premium entertainment to go along with the company's Chromecast streaming gadget. For $64.99, you'll get both the Chromecast with Google TV and three months of HBO Max. The device usually retails for $49.99, and HBO Max's ad-free tier costs $14.99 per month, so you're basically getting two months of the service for free.
