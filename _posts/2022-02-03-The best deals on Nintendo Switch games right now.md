The overwhelming popularity of the Nintendo Switch means there's no shortage of games in its library. If there's a game that's capable of working with the Switch hardware, odds are it's already available or will be soon. Thankfully, having a massive library of games also means there are regular price breaks on a variety of titles, from first-gen offerings like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, to remasters like Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1+2.
