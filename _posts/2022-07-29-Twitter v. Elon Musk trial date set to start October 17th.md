We have a schedule for the Delaware Court of Chancery trial over Twitter's lawsuit against Elon Musk for attempting to exit his agreement to buy the company for $44 billion. Earlier this week, the Musk team proposed an October 17th start date, which Twitter agreed to provided that the trial could be wrapped up in five days. Now, Judge Kathaleen McCormick has issued an official schedule, with the trial taking place from October 17th until October 21st.
