Apple will continue to accept App Store app submissions through the holidays, marking a shift from the company's approach in the past. Typically, Apple doesn't let developers make submissions through the App Store Connect portal for a few days around Christmas, meaning that they would have to rush to release apps or updates ahead of when many people receive new Apple devices or gift cards as holiday presents. With this change, it seems as if the App Store will hum along largely like you're used to this holiday season.
