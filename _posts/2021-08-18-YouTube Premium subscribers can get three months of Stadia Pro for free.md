Google is offering a new promotion to YouTube Premium subscribers — three free months to try the games included in Stadia Pro, as long as you're a new subscriber (via 9to5Google). While there's a chance someone willing to pay to remove ads from YouTube may have already messed around with Stadia, three months is a solid amount of time to see if cloud gaming makes sense for you, and it's two months longer than Stadia's usual free trial.
