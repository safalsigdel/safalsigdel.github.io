Anker just showed off a slew of new gallium nitride (GaN) chargers dubbed GaNPrime, which adopt the latest GaN 3 fast-charging tech to push up to 150 watts of power while taking up even less space than the previous generation. Anker points out that its new flagship 150W GaNPrime charger is 38 percent smaller than Apple's 140W GaN MacBook Pro charger, and Anker's 120W version is 39 percent smaller than Apple's 96-watt MacBook Pro charger, which provides an obvious edge in portability.
