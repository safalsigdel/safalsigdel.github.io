The Xbox Series X is sometimes a little easier to buy than Sony's PlayStation 5, but that doesn't mean it's a simple endeavor. The good news is that Best Buy has a restock of the flagship Xbox Series X consoles for its usual price of $499.99. The bad news is that this round of inventory is restricted to subscribers of Best Buy's Totaltech, which costs $199.99 per year.
