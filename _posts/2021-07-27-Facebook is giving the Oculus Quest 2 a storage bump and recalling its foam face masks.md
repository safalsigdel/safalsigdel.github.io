Facebook is pausing worldwide sales of the Oculus Quest 2 while it upgrades the headset's storage and replaces its foam facial covers with a new silicone design. Starting August 24th, all Quest 2 virtual reality headsets will come with a minimum of 128GB of storage instead of 64GB. They'll ship with a silicone interface between your face and the headset instead of the old foam design. And all current Quest 2 owners can request a free silicone mask online to replace their foam one, thanks to a recall after some users reported skin irritation.
