The Amazon Labor Union (ALU) is moving forward with unionization efforts at Amazon's JFK8 warehouse after having “reached a sufficient showing of interest” to hold an election, according to National Labor Relations Board spokesperson Kayla Blado. The NLRB says that it's scheduled a hearing for February 16th, after which the specifics and date for the election will be decided. This is only the second time Amazon's warehouse workers have made it to this point in the unionization process, as Vice reporter Lauren Kaori Gurley pointed out on Twitter.
