Once upon a time, my smartphone doubled as my most-used gaming platform. It's hard to believe now, but there was once a period when app stores felt like a new frontier, and game developers had a blast experimenting with a little touchscreen rectangle that you always had in your pocket. Then the economics changed. Games slowly got cheaper before eventually becoming free altogether. New releases had to decide between a dwindling audience for premium games or saddling their game with in-app purchases. Things became dire. But lately, I've been having fun with my phone again â€” and it's due almost entirely to subscription services.
