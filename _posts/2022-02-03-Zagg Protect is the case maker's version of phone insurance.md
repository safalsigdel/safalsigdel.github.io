Zagg, a company known for its cases and screen protectors, is now offering its own phone protection plan to compete with the likes of AppleCare, SquareTrade, and Asurion. The company is pitching its Zagg Protect service as a lower-cost and more flexible alternative to other plans — it's $100 a year, the deductible for incidents is only $49, and you don't have to decide if you want it while you're buying a new phone. Zagg says any phone running iOS 11 or newer or that runs Android and has access to Chrome browser version 68 or newer is eligible, as long as it's in working condition when you sign up.
