Like Amazon's Echo Dot, the Google Nest Mini is a miniature take on the larger smart speakers that came before it. The compact device doesn't boast the same sound quality as the Nest Audio, but it's impressive for its size, especially when mounted to a wall or placed in a smaller room. What's more, it packs backlit volume buttons and many of the same features that have come to define the category, including the ability to answer voice queries, control your smart home, and play music, adding to its overall versatility.
