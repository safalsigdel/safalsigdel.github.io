Valve is doubling the number of Steam Decks it ships to customers, the company announced Monday. “Production has picked up, and after today we'll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!” Valve said in a tweet from the official Steam Deck account. And in response to a question from my colleague Sean Hollister, Valve designer Lawrence Yang spelled out the change more clearly: “in previous weeks we were shipping x units / week to customers, starting this week we'll be shipping 2x units / week.”
