The huge space exploration game No Man's Sky will be available on the Nintendo Switch on October 7th, developer Hello Games revealed Thursday. That's a bit later than the summer timeline announced in February, but it's good to have a concrete date to look forward to. Physical and digital editions will be released on launch day.
