Robot vacuums have come a long way since the days I used to babysit my original Roomba (circa 2006), following it around to make sure it didn't thrash around on a threshold or ignore the miniature lighthouses and trundle unseeingly into a no-go zone. Back then, my biggest issue was coming home to a robot vacuum that had gone about 10 minutes into its cleanup route and been derailed by a shoe, sock, or dress-up wig.
