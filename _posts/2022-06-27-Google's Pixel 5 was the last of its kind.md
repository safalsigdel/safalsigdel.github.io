From time to time, I'll grab a random device out of the Verge reviews closet and spend a week or two with it. It's mostly out of random curiosity and for the sake of comparing “old” products against the latest and greatest. Most recently, I was drawn to Google's Pixel 5. So I gave it a factory reset, updated the phone to Android 12, and have been using it as my daily driver for the past several days.
