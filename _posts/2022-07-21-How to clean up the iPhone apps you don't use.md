As we use our phones year after year or transfer everything over to a new device, many of us have accumulated a catalog of apps that we downloaded at one point but haven't actually used in months (or possibly years). Whether it's a failed social network, the companion app for the smart device you threw in the trash or just Duolingo shaming you for giving up on learning Spanish, all these apps can take up valuable space on our phone's storage, clutter up our home screens, and, in worst case scenarios, even drain our batteries.
