You can't expect the world from $39 earbuds. After reviewing a series of much pricier products, I've spent the last few days trying out the new OnePlus Nord Buds. There's something unflattering about the name to me; “Nord Buds” sounds like a prop that would've been used on Mork & Mindy circa 1979. But it matches the branding of OnePlus' budget phone lineup, which has proven to be impressive, so it makes sense for the company to expand the brand to budget earbuds. Regardless, the features and performance of these inexpensive buds are more relevant than what they're called.
