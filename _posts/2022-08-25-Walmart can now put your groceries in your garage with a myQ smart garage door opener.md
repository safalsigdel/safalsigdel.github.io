Walmart is expanding its Walmart Plus InHome program, adding Chamberlain's myQ smart garage door controller technology to its list of in-home / in-garage delivery partners. Starting in September, Walmart Plus InHome delivery customers can have their groceries securely delivered into their garage if they have a myQ smart garage door controller. And if they don't have one, the company will install one for free.
