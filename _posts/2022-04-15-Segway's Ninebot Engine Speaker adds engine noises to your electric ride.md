Segway has a new speaker accessory attachment for its electric scooters that makes V8 engine noises. The Ninebot Engine Speaker is a Bluetooth wireless speaker that straps onto a number of Segway's personal transport vehicles. It can not only get rowdy with your favorite beats but also cause a ruckus like there's a neighborhood drag race (via Gizmodo).
