Corsair's K70 Pro Mini Wireless is the company's first mechanical keyboard to feature hot-swappable switches, which means you can easily remove and replace them with an included tool â€” no soldering required. The $179.99 (xc2xa3169.99 / xe2x82xac189.99) keyboard is also wireless, lasting up to 200 hours on battery with its RGB lighting turned off.
