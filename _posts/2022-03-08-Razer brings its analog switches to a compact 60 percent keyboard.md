If you were tempted by Razer's analog keyboard last year but want something a little more compact, then the Huntsman Mini Analog might be worth a look. Razer says this is the first time it's brought its Analog Optical Switches to a keyboard with a 60 percent layout, which means it doesn't have a function row, numpad, or even arrow keys. The result is a very diminutive accessory, ideal for anyone with limited desk space.
