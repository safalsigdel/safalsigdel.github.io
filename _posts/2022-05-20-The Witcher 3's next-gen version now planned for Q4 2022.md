The next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is “planned” to release in Q4 2022, developer CD Projekt Red (CDPR) announced Thursday. Previously, CDPR was targeting a Q2 2022 launch for the free update, but it pushed the release in April without providing a new date. Alongside that April announcement, CDPR said it would be bringing development of the update in-house, meaning it would be taking the reins from Saber Interactive.
