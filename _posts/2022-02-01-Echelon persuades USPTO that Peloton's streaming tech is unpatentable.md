In some more bad news for Peloton, rival Echelon Fitness has persuaded the US Patent and Trademark Office that two of Peloton's patents related to streaming and on-demand classes aren't actually patentable. The decision was made last week by the USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board as they were found to be “obvious inventions,” according to Bloomberg Law. While it may not be the biggest blow Peloton has faced in recent months, it does raise questions about the company's tendency to be heavy-handed with patent lawsuits.
