Although Dr. Brain stumbles through its world-building at times, there is something deeply bold and profoundly ambitious in this first Korean original series on Apple TV Plus. Dr. Brain takes off as a six-episode thriller starring Lee Sun-kyun (of Parasite fame) as neuroscientist Dr. Koh Se-won. It's an encouraging start for the streamer's Korean debut, though the show doesn't quite deliver on the promise of its fascinating premise and excellent cast.
