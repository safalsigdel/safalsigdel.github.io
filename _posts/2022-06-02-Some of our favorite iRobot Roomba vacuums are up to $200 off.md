If you're late on your spring cleaning, now is the perfect time to play catchup and save some money in the process. There are some great discounts running on Roomba smart vacuums from iRobot. These deals cover a couple of our favorite models, like the Roomba j7 and Roomba i3 EVO, both as standalone bots or with their respective auto-emptying stations. The discounts range from $100 to $200 off at a variety of retailers as well as directly from iRobot's site, where the manufacturer indicates that the sale is running through June 18th.
