At some point in the last month, Apple introduced a new verification process in the US that tried to ensure customers who want to benefit from its discounted education pricing are actually involved in education. Now Apple has removed the verification process, as confirmed in tests by The Verge, and backed up by reports from MacRumors and 9to5Mac. When it was in place, customers had to verify that they actually qualified for an education discount using Unidays' third-party verification service.
