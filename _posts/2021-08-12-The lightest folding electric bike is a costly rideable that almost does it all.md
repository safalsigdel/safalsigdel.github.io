“The world's lightest folding electric bike” is a claim that ostensibly ticks all the boxes for a rideable. A foldable design that makes it easy to store and carry on public transport? Check. An electric motor to take the effort out of hills? Check. A light 22.7-pound (10.3kg) construction that makes it easier to carry in and out of train stations and into your walk-up apartment? Check. The Hummingbird Folding Electric Bike Gen 2.0 has a lot going for it on paper.
