It doesn't take long for the Paper Girls comic books to get strange. The series from Brian K. Vaughan and Cliff Chiang starts out with a dream about an astronaut with angel wings and a skull for a face, and before the first issue is done, you'll have seen an odd partially-organic space capsule and read a completely incomprehensible language from people who might be monsters. Things only get weirder from there.
