Instagram is rolling out a new feature it calls Private Story Likes, which lets you like somebody's Insta Story without sending them a DM. Previously, any response you sent to someone about a Story — whether it was an emoji or a full-on message — showed up as a response in their DM inbox; with this new feature, you can show some appreciation for a Story without clogging up the user's DMs.
