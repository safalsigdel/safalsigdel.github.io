The popular Vanced YouTube app is being discontinued, after a legal threat from Google. The creators of Vanced have revealed the project will be shut down in the coming days, with download links set to be removed. While the app will continue to work for anyone who currently has it installed on Android, without any future updates it's likely to stop working at some point soon. The Vanced owners say they've had to discontinue the project “due to legal reasons.”
