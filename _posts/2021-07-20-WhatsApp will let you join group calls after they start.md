WhatsApp is rolling out a new joinable calls feature which will let you hop onto group calls after they've started, the Facebook-owned company announced Monday. The new feature means you'll be able to join a call with your friends and family when you're ready, kind of like what you can do with a group Zoom or Google Meet call right now. Given the massive popularity of WhatsApp, this could be a useful feature for many people who communicate over the messaging service.
