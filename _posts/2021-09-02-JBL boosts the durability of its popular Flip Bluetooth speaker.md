JBL has announced an update to its popular lineup of Flip Bluetooth speakers with the Flip 6. Perhaps the biggest change is that the latest speaker is now officially dustproof thanks to its IP67 rating, while the Flip 5 was officially only waterproof (IPX7). Its Bluetooth version has also been boosted from 4.2 to 5.1, and it features a newly redesigned JBL logo. Battery life is unchanged at around 12 hours. It'll retail for $129.95 when it goes on sale in December in the US, up from the Flip 5's current $119.95 price.
