Back in February, Nike sued StockX, a popular online sneaker reseller, for launching a non-fungible token (NFT) series based on Nike's shoes. It then accused StockX last month of knowingly selling counterfeits — a thing that shouldn't be possible since StockX claims it authenticates the shoes sold on its site. Now, StockX is hitting back. In a court filing, the sneaker reseller says that Nike's complaint is “nothing more than a failed attempt to bolster its still meritless claims.”
