Horizon Forbidden West's February 18th release is almost here, but if you're planning on getting a digital version of the game directly from Sony to play on your PS5, you should hold up just a second before pushing the buy button. While you might see listings for $69.99, such as on this landing page, you should know that the standard edition of the PS4 version of Horizon Forbidden West is $10 cheaper and has a free upgrade to the PS5 version.
