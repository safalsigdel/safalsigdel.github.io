Nexon, which develops the popular MMORPG MapleStory, wants to bring its gaming franchises to film and TV, and it's investing nearly half a billion dollars — and the potential for more — to do so. The company announced Wednesday that it's making a minority investment of $400 million in AGBO, a company founded by Avengers co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and producer Mike Larocca, and says it will invest up to an additional $100 million in the first half of this year “if requested by AGBO.”
