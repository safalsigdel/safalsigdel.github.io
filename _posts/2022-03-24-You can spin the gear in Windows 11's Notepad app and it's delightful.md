I've just spent an hour spinning the gear in Windows 11's new Notepad app. Reddit users discovered this delightful addition to Windows 11 recently, and as a daily Notepad user I'm addicted. Not on the level of my 1990s Solitaire addiction, but I can't seem to stop spinning this damn gear every time I open Notepad now. Spin, spin, spin.
