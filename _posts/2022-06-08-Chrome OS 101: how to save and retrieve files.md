A few years ago, I was shopping for a Chromebook to take on a business trip. I wanted something lightweight enough to carry around all day and inexpensive enough that I wouldn't mind as much when I spilled coffee on the keyboard. I was considering two different models when a sales rep came over to see if I needed help. “You're aware,” he said, “that these are Chromebooks, right? They only work online; you can't save any files to the hard drive.”
