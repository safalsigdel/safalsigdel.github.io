Ikea's second-generation Symfonisk table lamp speaker has leaked thanks to a support document posted to Ikea's Portuguese website (spotted by a Reddit user who claims to have encountered the lamp shades in a store), featuring a new design that streamlines the speaker-lamp's base and adds the much-needed option to swap in different styles of lampshades, via Janko Roettgers on Twitter.
