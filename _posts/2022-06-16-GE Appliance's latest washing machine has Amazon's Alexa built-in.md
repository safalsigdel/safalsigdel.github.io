We've all been there. You've got a grass stain on your linen pants or you have a new cashmere sweater and you have no idea which wash cycle to use to get it clean. You could Google it, or call your mom, or — if you buy the new $1,299 GE Profile Top Load 900 series washing machine — you can ask Alexa to do it for you.
