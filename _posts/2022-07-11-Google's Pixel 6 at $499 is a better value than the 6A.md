We're less than a day away from Prime Day 2022 kicking off. Those Prime member deals will begin at 3AM ET / 12AM PT on July 12th. But, as we saw last week, some companies aren't waiting until then to begin striking prices down to the lowest that we've seen so far this year. For example, Google's Pixel 6 with 128GB of storage is $100 off at Amazon and Best Buy (when you click activate later), costing $499 for the unlocked phone. It was already a stunning value at full price, but it's truly in a class of its own for under $500. And, if you want the 256GB version, it's $100 off, too, costing $599. Considering that the Pixel 6A will debut for $449 later this month, this might be the better deal for you.
