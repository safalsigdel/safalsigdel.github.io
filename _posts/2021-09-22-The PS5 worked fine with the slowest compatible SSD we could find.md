If your PS5 is already running out of speedy solid state storage, there's a fix. Sony's new update for the PS5, released in full on September 14th, allows you to expand your paltry 667GB of usable space by popping in the same sort of M.2 SSD stick you might slip into your laptop or desktop PC. My colleague Mitchell has a PS5 SSD buying guide right here that meets all of Sony's recommendations, such as speeds of at least 5,500MB/s. That might leave you wondering, though: what about slower SSDs?
