Okay, I know this might be partially my fault. When I reviewed Microsoft's 13.5-inch Surface Book 3 last year, I complained that the design was dated. I complained that my biggest nitpicks about the Surface Book 2 (which I've owned for years, by the way) hadn't been fixed. Microsoft still hadn't figured out how to do anything new or fun with the detachable, I lamented. “This form factor might be a dead end.”
