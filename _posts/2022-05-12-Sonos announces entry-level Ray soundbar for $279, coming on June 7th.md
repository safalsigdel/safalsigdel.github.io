Sonos this afternoon officially announced its Sonos Ray soundbar. Matching the specs and design that The Verge first reported last month, the company's new entry-level soundbar will cost a slightly higher-than-speculated $279 when it goes on sale on June 7th. (Hey, maybe Sonos is feeling inflation just like the rest of us.) That still makes the Ray far and away the most affordable Sonos soundbar yet, with the $449 Beam and $899 Arc above it.
