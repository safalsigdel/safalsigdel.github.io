Apple's Find My app has been a very useful (and reassuring) feature, allowing you to locate a misplaced (or stolen) phone so that you can retrieve it (or contact the authorities, if that's safer). With the expansion of Find My to a variety of other objects, especially via Apple's AirTags, it's become even more useful. And now that iOS 15 brings with it the capability to locate your phone even if the battery has run out or it's been turned off, the utility of Find My has become even greater.
