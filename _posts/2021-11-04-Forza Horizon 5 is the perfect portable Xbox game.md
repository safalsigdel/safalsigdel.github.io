Forza Horizon 5 is an absolutely stunning showcase of the Xbox Series X. Cars look incredible, and I've loved taking in the game's lush and colorful landscapes as I've raced through the streets of Mexico blasting classical music. On a console that's largely lacking in big-name exclusives, it's one of the rare games that really shows what the latest Xbox is capable of. Turns out it's also a fantastic portable game.
