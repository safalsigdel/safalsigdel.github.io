The Galaxy Z Flip 4 is a great little foldable held back by a too-tiny front display. It's just hard doing much on a 1.9-inch screen. Even though Samsung tried making it a little more useful in this year's iteration, it's still just a little window from which you can view notifications and certain widgets, but not much more. Developer IJP addresses just this pain point with its Cover Screen OS, a free app on the Google Play Store. It's been available for the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and got a recent update to support the Flip 4. And it works â€” but it's also kind of awful for reasons outside of the developers' control.
