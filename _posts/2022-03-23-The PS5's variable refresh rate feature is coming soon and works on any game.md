Sony is planning to release a Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) feature for the PlayStation 5 “in the coming months.” The long-awaited VRR feature will sync the refresh rate of a display to the PS5's graphical output, and will reduce visual artifacts, screen tearing, and frame pacing issues. You'll even be able to use the new VRR feature with games that don't officially support it. The news comes as Sony announced the availability of new PS5 and PS4 software updates.
