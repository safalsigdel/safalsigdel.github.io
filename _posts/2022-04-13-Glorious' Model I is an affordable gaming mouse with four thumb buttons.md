Glorious PC Gaming Race has announced the Model I, a lightweight wired mouse that's both comfortable and capable. It costs $59.99, and it's available in matte black or white. This new mouse is made for medium-to-large hands, and unlike the fan-favorite Model O and D, the Model I feels a little more ergonomic in my palm, with a thumb rest that widens the footprint of its bottom. Its design fills my hand in a similar way to Razer's Basilisk mouse, and its size doesn't get in my way of reaching its buttons. It feels wonderful to use.
