If you like your lighting to be on the adventurous side, rest assured that Nanoleaf's canvas light panels aren't made to be subtle. The touch-sensitive squares are flashy and versatile, with the ability to display more than 16 million colors and a modular design that lets you place them in a variety of patterns. The bright LED panels also work with all the major smart home platforms, and can cycle through a number of preset colors or respond to sound when in “Rhythm Mode,” a feature that's just as suited for the ambient noise outside your bedroom as your favorite record. Right now, Costco members can purchase Nanoleaf's Canvas Light Panel smarter pack with nine panels and everything needed to get started for $150, one of the better prices we've seen on the intuitive lighting system.
