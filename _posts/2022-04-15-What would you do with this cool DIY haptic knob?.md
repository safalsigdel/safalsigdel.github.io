Sometimes you come across a DIY project and immediately start figuring out ways you could use it in your life. That's what happened to us here at The Verge when someone dropped the SmartKnob View, a proof-of-concept project by engineer Scott Bezek, into our Slack chat. While it doesn't seem like it's the type of project most people could go out and build themselves at the moment (more on that later), it's easy to imagine a future where it's available as a kit, or where somebody turns it into an actual product.
