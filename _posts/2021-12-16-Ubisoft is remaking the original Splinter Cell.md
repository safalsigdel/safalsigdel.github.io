Ubisoft announced that a remake of the original Splinter Cell is in the works, and it's promising to both keep the stealthy spirit of the 2002 game while making it comfortable to play for modern gamers. It's being developed by Ubisoft Toronto, and the company says it'll use the Snowdrop engine it co-developed (and has used in games like The Division and Mario + Rabbids) to take advantage of the tech offered by new consoles.
