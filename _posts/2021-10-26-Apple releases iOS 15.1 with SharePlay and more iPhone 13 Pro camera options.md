Apple is releasing iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 today, and the big new feature is SharePlay's return. SharePlay is a feature that was originally supposed to ship in iOS 15; it lets people call friends or family and watch movies, TV, or listen to music together. SharePlay syncs content so everyone can watch it at the same time.
