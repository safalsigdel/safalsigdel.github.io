When Apple announced the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with Mini LED backlighting earlier this year, I knew it was time to upgrade from my 2018 model. And I wasn't disappointed. The improved brightness (especially when watching movies in HDR) and superior contrast have made the purchase worthwhile â€” even if iPadOS continues to underwhelm and disappoint in other ways. It's a wonderful screen that makes me want to use the iPad wherever I can instead of my laptop.
