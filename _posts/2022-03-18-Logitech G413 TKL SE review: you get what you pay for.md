I have a confession: I'm exhausted by keyboard RGB lighting. Ever since Cherry announced its debut MX RGB switches at the end of 2013, it feels like no mainstream mechanical keyboard has been complete without a set of lights capable of twinkling like a Christmas tree. But I switch them to plain white at the first opportunity. I want to be able to see my keys, not get distracted by them.
