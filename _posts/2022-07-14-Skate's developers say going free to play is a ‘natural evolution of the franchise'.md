EA's new Skate is going to be a live-service free-to-play skateboarding game, developer Full Circle announced in a video on Thursday. Fans have been eagerly asking for some kind of Skate 3 follow-up for years, but this new title won't be the Skate 4 they might have been expecting; instead of a numbered iteration, Full Circle is imagining Skate (that's the name, though EA stylizes it with a period at the end) as a constantly evolving world with community-created content that's easy for everyone to ollie into.
