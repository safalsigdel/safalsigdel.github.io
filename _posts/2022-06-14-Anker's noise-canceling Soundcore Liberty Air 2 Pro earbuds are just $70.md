It's not every day when you can buy a pair of decent wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is why today's deal on Anker's Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro is such a standout. For a limited time, you can buy the excellent, budget-friendly earbuds at Amazon and Best Buy for just $69.99, a new record low, instead of $129.99.
