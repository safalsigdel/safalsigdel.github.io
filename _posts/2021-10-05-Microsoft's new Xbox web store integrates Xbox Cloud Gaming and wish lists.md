Microsoft is starting to roll out a new Xbox web store that integrates Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud), wish lists, and more. The new Xbox web store includes buttons to add games to wish lists, quick access to redeem codes, and full Xbox Cloud Gaming integration. If you're an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member, you can simply click play on a supported game, and it will instantly stream from the web.
