Windows 11 comes with more restrictive install requirements when compared to its predecessor, including restrictions on older processors as well as requiring an internet connection and Microsoft account. Luckily, there are workarounds that allow for upgrades to Windows 11 on unsupported CPUs, and the company isn't blocking those circumventions. But, if you're looking to do a clean Windows 11 install and configure the system with just a local account, you can now do that easily with a tool called Rufus.
