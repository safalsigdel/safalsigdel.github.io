Tesla is recalling 130,000 cars due to an issue causing the CPU in vehicles' infotainment systems to overheat during fast charging, potentially making the car's touchscreen malfunction or go completely blank (via The Associated Press). The electric car maker started rolling out an over-the-air update (OTA) on May 3rd to fix the issue on affected vehicles, which include the 2022 Model 3 and Y, as well as the 2021 and 2022 Model X and S.
