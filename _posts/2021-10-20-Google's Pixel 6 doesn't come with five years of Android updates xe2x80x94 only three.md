For the first time ever, Google's new phones are powered by a Google-designed chip, giving the company an Apple-like level of control over the inner workings of the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. But if you were hoping that meant they'd also get an Apple-like level of new OS updates, the company is throwing a bit of cold water on that.
