Steam may certainly have the lion's share when it comes to building a library of PC games, but why would you leave yourself stranded in Valve's ecosystem when there are mountains of free games and sales on the Epic Games Store and other platforms? For instance, in 2021, the Epic Games Store gave away 89 free games, and GOG is adding new games to its free library all the time. If you had EGS and GOG on your Steam Deck, you could also cash in on all the extra sales that you'd otherwise be missing.
