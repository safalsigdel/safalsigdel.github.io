Discounts don't usually arrive quickly for the latest Apple tech, but you can enjoy a steep price cut on Apple's latest iPad Air, which has the M1 processor and a generous 256GB of storage. It normally costs $749 for that tablet configuration, but Walmart and Amazon are selling it for $679. It's worth noting that this price cut is limited to the space gray colorway at both retailers.
