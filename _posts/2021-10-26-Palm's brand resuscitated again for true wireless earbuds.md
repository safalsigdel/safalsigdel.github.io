After launching the Palm Phone in 2019, the reincarnated “Palm” is back again with its next new product. But it's not another smartphone. Instead, the startup that now owns the Palm brand is jumping on the trend of true wireless earbuds. The Palm Buds Pro — yes, yet another “Pro” gadget — are available to preorder starting today for $99, though they'll eventually rise to an MSRP of $129. For that price, you'll be getting a set of earbuds with noise cancellation, bass-heavy 10-millimeter drivers, and IPX4 water and sweat resistance.
