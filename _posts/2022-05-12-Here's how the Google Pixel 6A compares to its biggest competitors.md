The Pixel 6A is the latest phone to join the competitive upper tier of midrange phones, also occupied by Samsung, Apple, and more. Google announced the new phone onstage at its I/O 2022 keynote, detailing just a few key things about it. First thing you should know: it isn't coming out immediately. Unlike how many announcements take place as products are on their way to retailers, this one won't be available to preorder until July 21st, 2022, with orders shipping the following week.
