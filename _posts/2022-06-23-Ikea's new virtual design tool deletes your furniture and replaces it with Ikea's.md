Ikea is launching a new virtual design tool today that can make it easier to imagine how its furniture might look in your home. Ikea Kreativ's Scene Scanner feature lets you scan a room using Ikea's iOS app, erase your existing furniture, and then place virtual furniture in its place. If you don't want to scan your own home, there are also over 50 virtual showrooms to place furniture in. Naturally, the process is designed to encourage you to order this furniture for real after browsing the virtual versions.
