With yesterday's announcement of the new X-H2 mirrorless camera, Fujifilm is trying to fill a hole in its lineup between its APS-C offerings and its medium format GFX line by putting a 40.2-megapixel sensor in its latest X-series body. This may seem like a bit of a compromise since Fujifilm doesn't have a full-frame system, but one benefit of sticking with its smaller sensors and just adding resolution is having a camera that's still fairly compact. I got to briefly try out a preproduction version of the new X-H2 and the recently released X-H2S at Fujifilm's X-Summit NYC event, and there may be a lot to like here if you're a loyal Fujifilm user. Here are some initial thoughts and finer details learned from the short time with these cameras.
