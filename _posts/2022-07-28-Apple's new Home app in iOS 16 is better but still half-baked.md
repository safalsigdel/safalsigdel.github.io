Apple's Home app has always felt like an afterthought. Probably because it was. Apple didn't want to make an app to control its HomeKit home automation software framework; it didn't release one until two years after HomeKit launched. Even when the Home app finally arrived with iOS 10 in 2016, it rarely saw any significant updates, and progress felt painfully slow. But with iOS 16 arriving this fall, the app is getting a ground-up redesign. It feels like Apple is finally taking its little smart home project seriously.
