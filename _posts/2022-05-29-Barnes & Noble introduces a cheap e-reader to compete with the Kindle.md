Barnes & Noble hasn't completely forgotten its lineup of Nook e-readers. Starting today, you can preorder the new Nook GlowLight 4e for $119.99. That's about $30 more than Amazon's cheapest Kindle and $20 cheaper than Amazon's extremely popular Paperwhite. But, unlike Amazon's products, there are no ads you have to pay to avoid, and you can easily sideload content.
