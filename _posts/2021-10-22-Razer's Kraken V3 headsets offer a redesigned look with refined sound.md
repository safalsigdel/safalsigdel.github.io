Razer has announced the Kraken V3 lineup, which has a refreshed design and new features. At the top of the offering is Razer's wireless Kraken V3 Pro, which costs $199.99 and has built-in haptics. If wireless isn't important to you, the Kraken V3 HyperSense for $129.99 has the same haptics feature, but with a few other tweaks. The $99.99 wired Kraken V3 doesn't feature haptics, but it's otherwise the same as the Kraken V3 HyperSense.
