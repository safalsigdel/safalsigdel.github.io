Welcome to the weekend! We're kicking things off today with a rare deal on the superb Sonos Roam, which remains one of the best Bluetooth speakers we've ever tested. Regularly $179.99, you can currently buy it from Best Buy, B&H Photo, and Sonos for just $143.20, the speaker's best price to date. That's less than the typical cost of the cheaper Sonos Roam SL, which is essentially the same speaker but without the built-in microphone.
