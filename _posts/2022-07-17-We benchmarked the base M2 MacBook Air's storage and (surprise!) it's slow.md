Previously, a number of reviewers have reported that Apple's entry-level M2 MacBook Pro's SSD is significantly slower than that of the M1 MacBook Pro due to the configuration of the storage models in the computer. Apple confirmed to The Verge that the base M2 MacBook Air has the same storage configuration as the Pro, so, naturally, we've been wondering if it would suffer from the same issue. Well, we've finally gotten our hands on a base model (including 256GB of storage and 8GB of memory) and the answer is: yes, it does.
