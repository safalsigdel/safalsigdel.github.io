There are a smattering of deals happening across the web. Some products we've covered are seeing some of the lowest prices yet. Like an 11.5-inch tablet with an OLED screen. For a limited time, Lenovo is discounting its Tab P11 Pro tablet that has a vivid OLED screen from its usual $500 price down to just $310 through Lenovo's official eBay page. This is the base model that has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.
