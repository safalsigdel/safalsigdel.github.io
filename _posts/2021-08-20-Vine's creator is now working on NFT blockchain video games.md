Dom Hofmann, one of Vine's founders and the creator of Byte and Peach, has a new project called Supdrive. In his tweet announcing Supdrive, he calls it an “on-chain fantasy game console,” which doesn't necessarily make it any more obvious as to what this project will look like. He's since explained in an announcement post, which you can read below, that it'll be a video game console that plays classic-style games (in the vein of Pacman or Asteroid), with NFTs acting as a sort of virtual cartridge.
