Amnesty International — part of the group that helped break the news of journalists and heads of state being targeted by NSO's government-grade spyware, Pegasus — has released a tool to check if your phone has been affected. Alongside the tool is a great set of instructions, which should help you through the somewhat technical checking process. Using the tool involves backing up your phone to a separate computer and running a check on that backup. Read on if you've been side-eyeing your phone since the news broke and are looking for guidance on using Amnesty's tool.
