It wasn't a sure thing that the Pixel Buds Pro would turn out to be good. Google has had a mixed, inconsistent track record with wireless earbuds so far. The original Pixel Buds in 2017 had such an unconventional design that something as fundamental as putting them back into the case was overly complicated. The Pixel Buds 2 moved to a much sleeker, true wireless form factor, but they were beset with connectivity issues and frequent audio dropouts. Google righted the ship with the low-end $99 Pixel Buds A-Series last year, but now all eyes are on the new, flagship $199 Pixel Buds Pro — the company's first earbuds with active noise cancellation — to see whether Google can really hang with the very best from Apple, Sony, Samsung, and others.
