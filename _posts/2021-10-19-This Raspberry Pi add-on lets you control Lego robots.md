Raspberry Pi is releasing an add-on that will let you use many of its tiny, inexpensive computers to control certain Lego robot motors and sensors. The add-on is called the Build HAT (HAT stands for Hardware Attached on Top), and slotting it onto a Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins will give you four ports that you can use to control Lego Education's SPIKE components, which the HAT and its software are specially designed for. It'll also connect to most other parts that use an LPF2 connector, including the components from the Lego Mindstorms robot inventor kit.
