Facebook and Ray-Ban are teasing an announcement around their upcoming smart glasses on September 9th. Ray-Ban posted a promotional page with a silhouette of a pair of glasses, the date “09.09 2021,” and the text “sign up now to get your release notification” — although it doesn't specify whether that's news about the release or the release itself. Ray-Ban's homepage also promises that “this is one story you're going to want to follow,” plausibly a reference to Facebook Stories.
