Facebook has shared the internal research about the impact of Instagram on teenage mental well-being reported on by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. The Wall Street Journal reported that the files showed Instagram knew the social media network has a negative affect on teens' mental health. Facebook has pushed back on the WSJ's characterizations of its research, saying that “it is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is ‘toxic' for teen girls.”
