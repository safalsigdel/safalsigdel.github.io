Updates to beloved gadgets can go one of two ways. Either a company tries to fix what ain't broke or builds upon a great foundation to create an even better product. For fans of the popular Garmin Forerunner 245, I'm happy to say that the new $349.99 Forerunner 255S is the latter. The result is a midrange running watch that punches far above its weight.
