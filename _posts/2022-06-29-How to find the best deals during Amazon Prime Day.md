Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Prime Day has become one of the biggest shopping events of the year. It's a two-day stretch wherein Amazon Prime members will likely find some of the best prices yet on popular tech products like video games, gaming peripherals, laptops, 4K TVs, phones, PC accessories, and more. Amazon announced that Prime Day 2022 will happen Tuesday, July 12th, and last through Wednesday, July 13th. Though Prime Day may not be all that Amazon has in store for big 2022 sale events. It's reportedly planning a second sale in the fall for Prime subscribers.
