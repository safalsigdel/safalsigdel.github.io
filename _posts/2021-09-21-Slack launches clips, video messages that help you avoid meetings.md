Slack is launching its new clips feature today, allowing coworkers to record video messages that exist in Slack channels. Clips supports audio from a microphone, alongside video and screen recordings. They're designed to help teams communicate across various time zones, and cut down on the amount of meetings that are now taking place in a hybrid work era.
