Sony's update adding the much-anticipated support for M.2 SSD storage expansion is here, letting you install more PS5 games than the 825GB built-in SSD allows. When the feature first launched in beta, Sony provided a list of requirements, making it clear that you wouldn't necessarily be able to just grab any SSD and chuck it in your PS5.
