It was wishful thinking that the Opal C1 would be discounted for Amazon Prime Day. It's not, but Opal is giving Verge readers the next best thing: an invite to buy one. You can bypass Opal's invite-only system right now by using the code opalverge. Click “Reserve” at the top of Opal's purchase page, then click “Buy with Invite” to enter the invite code. From there, you'll be able to enter the code, then quickly and easily purchase a black or white Opal C1 without having to wait for an invite to arrive in your inbox.
