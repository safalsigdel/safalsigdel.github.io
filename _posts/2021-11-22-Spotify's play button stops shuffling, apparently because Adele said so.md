Spotify has stopped shuffling albums by default following a request from Adele, according to a report by BBC. Previously, when viewing an album on Spotify, you'd see a small shuffle icon within the larger “Play” button. This indicated that Spotify would begin playing the album's songs in a random order, which isn't always what users would expect (or want) it to do.
