If you're a fan of Android Auto but hate having to plug in your phone, the Motorola MA1 could be worth a look â€” it's a USB dongle that turns your wired Android Auto-equipped car into one that can connect to your phone wirelessly. The MA1, which will for $90 starting January 30th, pairs with your phone using Bluetooth and then transmits data over 5Ghz Wi-Fi. Given that only a few cars support wireless Android Auto from the factory (especially compared to the ones that support the wired version), this gadget could make for a relatively easy and inexpensive upgrade.
