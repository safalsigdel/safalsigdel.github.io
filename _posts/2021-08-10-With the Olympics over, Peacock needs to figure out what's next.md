It's been a rocky couple of weeks for Peacock. NBC positioned its streaming service as the place to go if you wanted to stream the Olympics without a cable subscription â€” something that should have been an easy win for the upstart platform. Instead, Peacock's coverage was wonky and confusing, and the service hasn't given viewers much of a reason to stick around after the Games. With its biggest draw behind it and little in the way of internet-breaking titles headed to the platform anytime soon, it's unclear what comes next for NBCUniversal's biggest streaming bet.
