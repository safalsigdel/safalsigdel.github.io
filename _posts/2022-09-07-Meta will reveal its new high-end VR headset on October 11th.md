Meta has announced that its Connect Conference will be livestreamed on October 11th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. In a post on the Oculus blog, the company says it'll cover the progress it's made on the metaverse and offer “a look at what's to come in the near and far future.” The announcements can't measure up to last year's Connect, where the company changed its name from Facebook to Meta, but the company has said we'll see information on the Horizon Worlds virtual reality app and hinted that the high-end “Project Cambria” headset will show up as well.
