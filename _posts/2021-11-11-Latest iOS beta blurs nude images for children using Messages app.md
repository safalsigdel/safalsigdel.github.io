iOS 15.2's latest beta adds an Apple Communication Safety feature to the Messages app, MacRumors reports. The opt-in feature is designed to protect children from inappropriate imagery by scanning incoming and outgoing pictures for “sexually explicit” material. Any images meeting this description are blurred, and the child will be warned about its contents and told it's ok not to view it. The feature, which ties into Apple's existing Family Sharing system, is also designed to offer resources to affected children for them to get help.
