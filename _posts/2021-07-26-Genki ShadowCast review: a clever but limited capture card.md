The ShadowCast from Genki is a dongle-size video capture card that might provide all that some gamers and streamers need. It's $45, a relatively low price for a no-frills device that can get your console games onto your PC. But it has some limitations. The video quality isn't great, and there's a noticeable amount of lag if you're trying to play along with the stream. These compromises aren't a surprise, considering the ShadowCast costs a fraction of the price of something more capable like Elgato's HD60 S+.
