For years, my primary gaming display has been the Asus VS228H-P, a 21.5-inch screen with a 1920 x 1080 resolution I've had since late 2015. Even though it's old, I've had very few complaints with it. But when I picked up both a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X last year, I wondered if I wasn't using them to their full abilities by not having a monitor that could take advantage of the 120fps and 4K resolution of which the consoles were capable.
