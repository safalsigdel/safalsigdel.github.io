Bang & Olufsen's Beoplay EQ are the Danish audio brand's first pair of noise-canceling true wireless headphones. Two microphones on each earbud handle noise cancellation duties alongside an extra mic for making calls, for a total of six across the two earbuds. They're releasing globally on August 19th in black and gold.
