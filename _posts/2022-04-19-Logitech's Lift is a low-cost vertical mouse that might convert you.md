Logitech has announced Lift, a $69.99 wireless vertical mouse that's launching today in multiple colorways, as well as with both right- and left-handed options. The Lift features a vertically oriented design that puts your hand at a 57-degree angle for better ergonomics. Compared to using a traditional mouse, using mice like the Lift may help to greatly reduce wrist strain since you're holding your wrist at a similar angle to shaking someone's hand. At least, that's what I experienced. Last year, I made the shift to a split ergonomic keyboard, and a mouse like the Lift completes the setup.
